To see the output of a loop for example we can run rs274 on the following file
and see that the loop never ends. To break out of the loop use Ctrl Z. The
following two files are needed to run the example.

test.ngc

 #<test> = 123.352
 o101 while [[#<test> MOD 60 ] NE 0]
 (debug,#<test>)
    #<test> = [#<test> + 1]
 101 endwhile
