== Introduction

QtPlasmaC is a GUI for plasma cutting which utilises the link:http://linuxcnc.org/docs/devel/html/man/man9/plasmac.9.html[plasmac component] for controlling a plasma table from LinuxCNC v2.9 or later using the Debian Buster or similar distribution. QtPlasmaC uses the QtVCP infrastructure provided with LinuxCNC and is based on a theme by user "pinder" on the LinuxCNC Forum. There are three available formats:

[[qt_formats]]

* 16:9 with a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768
* 9:16 with a minimum resolution of 768 x 1366
* 4:3 with a minimum resolution of 1024 x 768

Screenshot examples of QtPlasmaC are below:

*16:9*

*9:16*

image::images/qtplasmac_9x16.png[width=550,align="center"]

*4:3*

image::images/qtplasmac_4x3.png[width=700,align="center"]

The PlasmaC component will run on any hardware that is supported by LinuxCNC provided there are enough hardware I/O pins to fulfill the requirements of a plasma configuration.

If the user is new to CNC plasma cutting, it is recommended that they read the link:plasma-cnc-primer.html[Plasma CNC Primer] document which is a generic introduction to CNC plasma cutting.

NOTE: Except where noted, this guide assumes the user is using the latest version of QtPlasmaC. Update notices are posted at: https://forum.linuxcnc.org/plasmac/37233-plasmac-updates which will show the latest available version. The installed QtPlasmaC version is displayed in the title bar. See <<qt_update, Update QtPlasmaC>> for information on updating QtPlasmaC.

== Installing LinuxCNC

The preferred method for installing LinuxCNC is via an ISO image as described below.

NOTE: It is possible to install and run LinuxCNC on a variety of Linux distributions however that is beyond the scope of this User Guide. If the user wishes to install a Linux distribution other than those recommended, they will first need to install their preferred Linux distribution and then install LinuxCNC v2.9 or later along with any required dependencies.

=== If The User Does Not Have Linux Installed

Installation instructions are available at: http://linuxcnc.org/docs/devel/html/getting-started/getting-linuxcnc.html

Following these instructions will yield a machine with the current stable branch (v2.8) of LinuxCNC on Debian Buster.

=== Package Installation (Buildbot) If The User Has Linux with LinuxCNC v2.8

A package installation (Buildbot) uses prebuilt packages from the LinuxCNC Buildbot, instructions for upgrading from 2.8 to 2.9 are available at: http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org

Following these instructions by using the below stanzas will upgrade the machine to the last LinuxCNC Buildbot build master branch (v2.9) of LinuxCNC. This may not always be the latest version of master branch (v2.9) as from time to time the LinuxCNC Buildbot may stop due to errors.

----
deb     http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ buster master-rtpreempt
deb-src http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ buster master-rtpreempt
----

=== Run In Place Installation If The User Has Linux with LinuxCNC v2.8

A run in place installation run LinuxCNC from a compiled version usually located at ~/linuxcnc-dev, instructions for building a run in place installation are available at: http://linuxcnc.org/docs/master/html/code/building-linuxcnc.html

Following these instructions will install the latest master branch (v2.9) of LinuxCNC.

=== Creating A Working Base Machine Configuration

It is recommended that the user choose the AXIS GUI to make the Base Machine Configuration.

NOTE: "Base machine configuration" means a complete working system without any of the plasma connections shown in the <<qt_io_requirements, I/O Requirements>> section. All axes should be working and tuned for best performance and all home and limit switches for X, Y, and Z axes (if installed) should be operating correctly.

IMPORTANT: DO *NOT* ADD ANY OF THE PLASMA CONNECTIONS SHOWN IN THE <<qt_io_requirements, I/O REQUIREMENTS>> SECTION AT THIS TIME, THESE I/O'S WILL BE ADDED LATER DURING THE QTPLASMAC SETUP USING THE <<qt_setup, qtplasmac-setup>> PROGRAM.

Some recommended settings:

[[qt_z-settings]]

* *[AXIS_Z] MIN_LIMIT* should be just below top of the slats with allowances for float_switch_travel and over travel tolerance. For example, if the user's float switch takes 4mm (0.157") to activate then set the Z minimum to 5mm (0.197") plus an allowance for overrun (either calculated using the equation below or allow 5mm (0.2")) below the lowest slat.
* *[AXIS_Z] MAX_LIMIT* should be the highest the user wants the Z axis to travel (it must not be lower than Z HOME_OFFSET).
* *[AXIS_Z] HOME* should be set to be approximately 5mm-10mm (0.2"-0.4") below the maximum limit.

* *Floating Head* - it is recommended that a floating head be used and that it has enough movement to allow for overrun during probing. Overrun can be calculated using the following formula:

----
o = 0.5 × a × (v ÷ a)^2
----

where: o = overrun, a = acceleration in units/sec2 and v = velocity in units/sec.

Metric example:  given a Z axis MAX_ACCELERATION of 600mm/s^2^ and MAX_VELOCITY of 60mm/s, the overrun would be 3mm.

Imperial example: given a Z axis MAX_ACCELERATION of 24in/s^2^ and MAX_VELOCITY of 2.4in/s, the overrun would be 0.12in.

On machines that will utilize an ohmic probe as the primary method of probing, it is highly recommended to install a switch on the floating head as a backup means of stopping Z motion in the event of ohmic probe failure due to dirty surfaces.

The user may opt to create a base machine manually or one of the existing configuration helpers may be used:

NOTE: It is highly recommended to keep the base machine config simple until it has been fully tested and tuned. +
If using Stepconf or Pncconf then deselect the VCP Panel, spindle, manual tool change, and classic ladder options. +
Any of the aforementioned options can be added manually at a later time should the need arise.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ANY OF THE <<qt_io_requirements, PLASMA SPECIFIC I/O REQUIREMENTS>> TO THE PNCCONF OR STEPCONF WIZARDS.

If using a Mesa Electronics board, use the <<cha:pncconf-wizard, pncconf wizard>> (enter the following command into a terminal window):

----
pncconf
----

If using a parallel port, use the <<cha:stepconf-wizard, stepconf wizard>> (enter the following command into a terminal window):

----
stepconf
----

If using a Pico Systems board: +
https://forum.linuxcnc.org/27-driver-boards/14977-pico-systems-faq[This LinuxCNC forum thread] may be helpful.

If the user already has a dual motor gantry configuration that requires the configuration to be hand edited: +
https://forum.linuxcnc.org/49-basic-configuration/33079-how-to-2-or-more-motors-on-one-axis-gantry-linuxcnc-2-8-master?start=0[This LinuxCNC forum thread] may be helpful.

IMPORTANT: BEFORE PROCEEDING, THE USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOME THE MACHINE, ZERO EACH AXIS, JOG ALL AXES TO SOFT LIMITS WITHOUT CRASHING, AND RUN TEST G-CODE PROGRAMS WITHOUT ANY ERRORS.

ONLY WHEN this criteria is met should the user proceed with using the created .hal and .ini files from a working configuration to switch to the QtPlasmaC GUI by running the qtplasmac-setup program.

CAUTION: DO *NOT* CONTINUE UNTIL THE BASE MACHINE IS CONFIGURED AND WORKING.

[[qt_io_requirements]]

== Plasma Specific I/O Considerations

Prior to using the qtplasmac-setup program, it is important that the user has a firm understanding of the operating modes available, as well as the I/O's that are required for successful plasma operation.

[[qt_mode]]

=== Modes

QtPlasmaC requires the selection of one of following three operating modes:

[width="100%",cols="4,16"]
|===
|*Mode*|*Description*
|0|Uses an external arc voltage input to calculate both Arc Voltage (for Torch Height Control) and Arc OK.
|1|Uses an external arc voltage input to calculate Arc Voltage (for Torch Height Control). +
   Uses an external Arc OK input for Arc OK.
|2|Uses an external Arc OK input for Arc OK. +
   Use external up/down signals for Torch Height Control.
|===

IMPORTANT: If the plasma power source has an Arc OK (Transfer) output then it is recommended to use that for Arc OK rather than the soft (calculated) Arc OK provided by mode 0. It may also be possible to use a <<qt_reed-arc-ok, reed relay>> as an alternative method to establish an Arc OK signal when the power source does not provide one.

=== Available I/Os

NOTE: This section only touches on the hardware I/O's required for QtPlasmaC. Base machine requirements such as limit switches, home switches, etc. are in addition to these and should already be configured and working prior to the user running the qtplasmac-setup program.

[width="100%",cols="4,2,14"]
|===
|*Name*|*Modes*|*Description*
|Arc Voltage|0, 1|Analog input; *optional.* +
                 Connected to the velocity output of an encoder equipped breakout board.
				 This signal is used to read the arc voltage to determine the necessary corrections to maintain the torch distance from the work piece during cutting.
|Arc OK|1, 2|Digital input; *optional.* +
                 Connected from the Arc OK output of the plasma power source to an input on the breakout board.
				 This signal is used to determine if the cutting arc has been established and it is ok for the machine to move (sometimes called arc transfer).
|Float Switch|0, 1, 2|Digital input; *optional, see info below table:* +
                    Connected from a breakout board input to a switch on the floating head.
					This signal is used to mechanically probe the work piece with the torch and set Z zero at the top of the work piece. +
                    If used and no ohmic probe is configured, this is the primary probing method. +
                    If used and an ohmic probe is configured, this is the fallback probing method.
|Ohmic Probe|0, 1, 2|Digital input; *optional, see info below table:* +
                   Connected from to the ohmic probe's output to a breakout board input.
				   This signal is used to probe electronically by completing a circuit using the work piece and the torch consumables and set Z zero at the top of the work piece. +
                   If used, this is the primary probing method.
				   If an ohmic probe fails to locate the work piece, and there is no float switch is present, probing will continue until the torch breaks away or the minimum Z limit is reached.
|Ohmic Probe Enable|0, 1, 2|Digital output; *optional, see info below table:* +
                   Connected from a breakout board output to an input to control the ohmic probe's power.
|Breakaway Switch|0, 1, 2|Digital input; *optional, see info below table:* +
                        Connected from a breakout board input to a torch breakaway detection switch. +
                  This signal senses if the torch has broken away from its cradle.
|Torch On|0, 1, 2|Digital output; *required.* +
                Connected from a breakout board output to the torch-on input of the plasma power supply.
				This signal is used to control the plasma power supply and start the arc.
|Move Up|2|Digital input; *optional.* +
           Connected from the up output of the external THC control to a break out board input.
		   This signal is used to control the Z axis in an upward motion and make necessary corrections to maintain the torch distance from the work piece during cutting.
|Move Down|2|Digital input; *optional.* +
             Connected from the down output of the external THC control to a break out board input.
			 This signal is used to control the Z axis in a downward motion and make necessary corrections to maintain the torch distance from the work piece during cutting.
|Scribe Arming|0, 1, 2|Digital output; *optional.* +
                     Connected from a breakout board output to the scribe arming circuit.
					 This signal is used to place the scribe into position on the work piece .
|Scribe On|0, 1, 2|Digital output; *optional.* +
                     Connected from a breakout board output to the scribe-on circuit.
					 This signal is used to turn the scribing device on.
|===

Only one of either *Float Switch* or *Ohmic Probe* is required. If both are used then *Float Switch* will be a fallback if *Ohmic Probe* is not sensed.

If *Ohmic Probe* is used then *Ohmic Probe Enable* is required to be checked on the QtPlasmaC GUI.

*Breakaway Switch* is not mandatory because the *Float Switch* is treated the same as a breakaway when not probing. If they are two separate switches, and there are not enough inputs on the breakout board, they could be combined and connected as a *Float Switch*.

NOTE: The minimum I/O requirement for a QtPlasmaC configuration to function are:  *Arc Voltage* input OR *Arc OK* input, *Float Switch* input, and *Torch On* output. To reiterate, in this case QtPlasmaC will treat the float switch as a breakaway switch when it is not probing.

IMPORTANT: THE ABOVE PINS WILL BE ENTERED LATER DURING THE QTPLASMAC SETUP PROCESS. MAKE NOTE OF THE CORRESPONDING INPUTS AND OUTPUTS ON THE BREAKOUT BOARD DURING WIRING. THESE PINS SHOULD *NOT* BE USED TO CREATE THE BASE MACHINE .HAL FILE.

== Installing QtPlasmaC To A Base Machine

By this point, the user NEEDS to have a fully tested and working base machine configuration without any connections to the plasma specific I/Os before proceeding. It is much more difficult to edit a base machine configuration after moving to QtPlasmaC as pncconf and stepconf can no longer be used to help edit the configuration.

CAUTION: DO *NOT* PROCEED UNTIL THE BASE MACHINE IS COMPLETE.

NOTE: If the user is using a *Mesa Electronics THCAD* card for arc voltage measurement, see <<qt_mesa-thcad, Mesa THCAD>> before proceeding.

[[qt-dependency]]

=== Qt Dependency Errors

If any Qt dependency errors are encountered at any point in the following process, the user may need to run the QtVCP installation script to resolve these issues.

For a package installation (Buildbot) enter the following command in a terminal window:

----
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qtvcp/designer/install_script
----

For a run in place installation enter the following command in a terminal window:

----
~/linuxcnc-dev/lib/python/qtvcp/designer/install_script
----

[[qt_setup]]

=== Setup

Installing a plasma configuration to a base machine and changing to the QtPlasmaC GUI is done via the qtplasmac-setup program.

For a package installation (Buildbot) enter the following command in a terminal window:

----
qtplasmac-setup
----

For a run in place installation enter the following two commands in a terminal window:

|===

NOTE: If unsure of the HAL pin's full name, the user may start LinuxCNC for the base machine and run *HalShow* for a full listing of all HAL pins.

Fill in the required entries to suit the machine wiring/breakout board configuration, click *Create* and a working QtPlasmaC configuration will be created in the following directory: ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine_name>

The newly created QtPlasmaC configuration can be run by entering the following command into a terminal window (*change "<machine_name>" to the machine name entered into the qtplasmac-setup program*):

For a package installation (Buildbot):

----
linuxcnc ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine_name>/<machine_name>.ini
----

For a run in place installation:

----
~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/linuxcnc ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine_name>/<machine_name>.ini
----

After creating a new configuration some initial setup is required before using QtPlasmaC.

[[qt_initial-setup]]

=== Initial Setup

After running the command at the end of section 5.1, LinuxCNC should be running with the QtPlasmaC GUI visible.

Click on the Parameters tab to view the *PLASMAC CONFIGURATION* section which shows the user settable parameters. It is necessary to ensure every one of these is tailored to the machine.

See <<qt_parameters-tab, Parameters Tab>>

. The user should be familiar with the recommended <<qt_z-settings, Z Axis Settings>>.

. Home the Z axis.

. Ensure there is nothing below the torch then jog the Z axis down until it stops at the Z axis MINIMUM_LIMIT then click *Touch Off* with the Z axis selected to set the Z axis at zero offset.

. Home the Z axis again.

[[qt_probe-test]]

If the machine is equipped with a float switch then the user will need to set the offset in the *PLASMAC CONFIGURATION* section of the *PARAMETERS* tab. This will be done by running a "Probe Test" cycle.

. Check that the Probe Speed and the Probe Height in the *PLASMAC CONFIGURATION* section of the *PARAMETERS* tab are correct. QtPlasmaC can probe at the full Z axis velocity so long as the machine has enough movement in the float switch to absorb any overrun. If the machine is suitable, the user could set the Probe Height to a value near the Z axis minimum and do all probing at full speed.

. If the machine is not already homed and in the home position, home the machine.

. Place some material on the slats under the torch.

. Press the Probe Test button.

. The Z axis will probe down, find the material then move up to the specified *Pierce Height* as set by the currently selected material. The torch will wait in this position for the time set in the <machine_name>.ini file. The default probe test hold time is 10 seconds, this value may be edited in the <machine_name>.ini file. After this the torch will return to the starting height.

. Measure the distance between the material and the tip of the torch while the torch is waiting at *Pierce Height*.

. If the measurement is greater than the *Pierce Height* of the currently selected material, then reduce the "Float Travel" in the *PLASMAC CONFIGURATION* section of the *PARAMETERS* tab by the difference between the measured value and the specified value. If the measurement is less than *Pierce Height* of the currently selected material, then increase the "Float Travel" in the *PLASMAC CONFIGURATION* section of the *PARAMETERS* tab by the difference between the specified value and the measured value.

. After the adjustments to the "Float Travel" have been made, repeat the process from #4 above until the measured distance between the material and the torch tip matches the *Pierce Height* of the currently selected material.

NOTE: If the amount of time between the torch contacting the material and when the torch moves up and comes to rest at the Pierce Height seems excessive, see <<qt_probing, the probing section>> for a possible solution.

IMPORTANT: IF USING A *Mesa Electronics THCAD* THEN UP UNTIL NOW THE *Voltage Scale* VALUE WAS OBTAINED MATHEMATICALLY. IF THE USER INTENDS TO USE CUT VOLTAGES FROM A MANUFACTURE'S CUT CHART THEN IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO DO MEASUREMENTS OF ACTUAL VOLTAGES AND FINE TUNE THE *Voltage Scale* AND *Voltage Offset*.

CAUTION: PLASMA CUTTING VOLTAGES CAN BE LETHAL, IF THE USER IS NOT EXPERIENCED IN DOING THESE MEASUREMENTS GET SOME QUALIFIED HELP.

[[qt_modify-config]]

=== Reconfigure An Existing QtPlasmaC Configuration

The qtplasmac-setup program may also be used to reconfigure an existing QtPlasmaC configuration to change settings instead of modifying files manually.

The qtplasmac-setup program cannot modify the following:

* The machine name.
* The machine HAL file.
* The machine INI file.

Reconfiguring a QtPlasmaC configuration is done from the <<qt_setup, qtplasmac-setup>> program.

It is highly recommended that a <<qt_backup, backup>> copy of the existing QtPlasmaC configuration is made before proceeding.

After starting qtplasmac-setup the selection window is visible, select *Reconfigure* which shows an information dialog, select *Continue* and the Reconfigure window will display:

image::images/qtplasmac_setup_reconfigure.png[width=500,align="center"]

Select the <machine_name>.ini file of the QtPlasmaC configuration to reconfigure.

If the user changes modes, the entry boxes will change depending on the currently selected mode.

When all entries are correct, click *Reconfigure* and the user's QtPlasmaC configuration will be reconfigured.

Entry descriptions can be found <<qt_setup-table, here>>.

NOTE: Machine Name and <machine_name>.hal File cannot be modified.

== Migrating to QtPlasmac From PlasmaC (Axis or Gmoccapy)

There are several methods available to get from a working PlasmaC configuration to a new QtPlasmaC configuration.  These methods assume the user is on LinuxCNC v2.9 or later, QtVCP is installed, and all dependency requirements are satisfied.

If there are Qt dependency errors, the user should run the <<qt-dependency, QtVCP install script>>.

=== Primary Method

The preferred method to move to QtPlasmaC from PlasmaC (loaded on top of either Axis or Gmoccapy) is to use the plasmac2qt conversion program which will attempt to create a new QtPlasmaC configuration from an existing PlasmaC .ini file. This program will convert the user's parameters, settings, and materials from the previous PlasmaC configuration and create a new QtPlasmaC configuration folder in the ~/linuxcnc/configs folder.

To run the plasmac2qt conversion program, use the following instructions:

For a package installation (Buildbot) enter the following line in a terminal window:

----
qtplasmac-plasmac2qt
----

For a run in place installation enter the following lines in terminal window:

----
source ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/rip-environment
qtplasmac-plasmac2qt
----

The following screen will be displayed:

image::images/qtplasmac_plasmac2qt.png[width=500,align="center"]

|===

After filling in the appropriate entries, press 'CONVERT'.

=== Alternate Method

An alternate method to move to QtPlasmaC from PlasmaC (loaded on top of either Axis or Gmoccapy) is to use the <<qt_setup, qtplasmac-setup program>> using the original base .ini file and base .hal file that were backed up to the PlasmaC configuration folder. The user can then further customize the .hal and .ini files to suite their configuration (different types of ohmic sensing, added components, etc.).

After using the setup program, the user can then run a conversion program (cfg2prefs) to convert their parameters, settings, and materials from the previous PlasmaC configuration to an existing QtPlasmaC configuration. This tool should be used immediately after the user has created a new QtPlasmaC configuration.

Prior to running this program, it is mandatory that the user have both an existing PlasmaC configuration and an existing QtPlasmaC configuration. This program WILL overwrite the existing QtPlasmaC preferences and materials files, and should be used with caution if it is not being run on a new QtPlasmaC configuration.

The program will create a time stamped backup of the original preferences file and the existing materials file (if it exists).

It will read the existing <machine_name>_config.cfg, <machine_name>_run.cfg, <machine_name>_wizards.cfg, and plasmac_stats.var files and write them to an existing qtplasmac.prefs file. It will also copy the plasma_material.cfg file to the existing QtPlasmaC configuration.

To run the cfg2prefs conversion program, use the following instructions:

For a package installation (Buildbot) enter the following line in a terminal window:

----
qtplasmac-cfg2prefs
----

For a run in place installation enter the following lines in terminal window:

----
source ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/rip-environment
qtplasmac-cfg2prefs
----

image::images/qtplasmac_cfg2prefs.png[width=500,align="center"]

Select the .ini file of the old PlasmaC configuration, select the .ini file of the new QtPlasmaC configuration, then press 'CONVERT'.

== Other QtPlasmaC Setup Considerations

[[qt_lowpass]]

=== Lowpass Filter

The PlasmaC component has an built in lowpass filter that if used is applied to the *plasmac.arc-voltage-in* input pin to filter any noise that could cause erroneous voltage readings. The lowpass filter should only be used after using Halscope to determine the required frequency and whether the amplitude of the noise is large enough to cause any issues. For most plasma machines lowpass is not required and should not be used unless it is required.

The HAL pin assigned to this filter is *plasmac.lowpass-frequency* and is set to 0 (disabled) by default. To apply a lowpass filter to the arc-voltage, the user would edit the following entry in the <machine_name>_connections.hal file in the machine's configuration directory to add the appropriate cutoff frequency as measured in Hertz (Hz).

For example:

----
setp plasmac.lowpass-frequency 100
----

The above example would give a cutoff frequency of 100Hz.

=== Contact Debounce

Contact bounce from mechanical relays, switches, or external interference may cause some inconsistent behavior of the following switches:

* Float Switch
* Ohmic Probe
* Breakaway Switch
* Arc OK (for modes 1 & 2)

Due to the fact that the software is capable of sampling rates faster than the contact bounce period, it is possible that the software may see contact bounce as several changes in input states occurring in a very small time period, and incorrectly interpret this as a very quick on-off of the input. One method of mitigating contact bounce is to "debounce" the input. To summarize debounce, as soon as the software sees an input with a debounce delay change states, it waits for a prescribed delay period before checking the state of the input again. After the debounce period the software will regard state changes as normal behavior of the input and react accordingly.

Debounce periods can be changed by editing the appropriate debounce value in the <machine_name>_connections.hal file in the <machine_name> config folder.

Each increment of delay adds one servo thread cycle to the debounce time. For example: given a servo thread period of 1000000 (measured in nano seconds), a debounce delay of 5 would equate to 5000000ns, or 5ms.

For the Float and Ohmic switches this equates to a 0.001mm (0.00004") increase in the probed height result.

It is recommended to keep the debounce values as low as possible while still achieving consistent results. Using link:http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.8/html/hal/tutorial.html#_halscope[Halscope] to plot the inputs is a good way to establish the correct value.

For QtPlasmaC installations, debounce is achieved by using the HAL link:http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.8/html/man/man9/dbounce.9.html[dbounce component] which is a later alternative to the original debounce component. This new version allows for the loading and naming of individual debounce instances and is compatible with Twopass HAL file processing.

All four signals above have an individual debounce component so the debounce periods can be catered individually to each input. Any changes made to these values in the <machine_name>_connections.hal file will not be overwritten by later updates of QtPlasmaC.

The default delay for all four inputs is five servo thread periods. In most cases this value will work quite well. If any of the inputs do not use mechanical switches, it may be possible to either reduce or remove the delay for those inputs.

If debounce is required for other equipment like home or limit switches etc then more dbounce components may added in any of the HAL files without any regard to the signals listed here.

=== Desktop Launcher

If a link to the launch the configuration was not created when creating the config, the user could create a desktop launcher to the config by right clicking on the desktop and selecting Create Launcher or similar. This will bring up a dialog to create a launcher. Give the icon a nice short name, enter anything for the command and click OK.

After the launcher appears on the desktop, right click on it and then edit it with the user's editor of choice. Edit the file so it looks similar to:

----
[Desktop Entry]
Comment=
Terminal=false
Name=LinuxCNC
Exec=sh -c "linuxcnc $HOME/linuxcnc/configs/<machine_name>/<machine_name>.ini"
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/linuxcncicon.png
----

If the user would like a terminal window to open behind the GUI window then change the Terminal line to:

----
Terminal=true
----

Displaying a terminal can be handy for error and information messages.

=== QtPlasmaC Files

After a successful QtPlasmaC installation, the following files are created in the configuration directory:
[width="100%",cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Filename*|*Function*
|<machine_name>.ini|A configuration file that includes the base system parameters, as well as various settings required by QtPlasmaC.
|<machine_name>.hal|A HAL connections file that includes the base system I/O HAL pin connections to LinuxCNC.
|<machine_name>_connections.hal|A HAL connections that includes  I/O HAL pin connections specific to QtPlasmaC.
|<machine_name>_material.cfg|This file is used to store the material settings from the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.
|postgui.tcl|A HAL file that is ran after the GUI has loaded for user customizing.
|tool.tbl|A tool table used to store offset information for additional tools (scribe, etc.) used by the QtPlasmaC configuration.
|qtplasmac.prefs|A file containing the users preferences and parameters
|===

NOTE: <machine_name> is whatever name the user entered into the "Machine Name" field of the qtplasmac-setup program
NOTE: Custom commands are allowed in <machine_name>_connections.hal and the postgui.tcl files as they are not overwritten during updates.

In addition to the above files, the following link is created:
[width="100%",cols="1,2"]

[[qt_conversational-tab]]

=== CONVERSATIONAL Tab

Screenshot example of the QtPlasmaC CONVERSATIONAL tab in *16:9* aspect ratio:

image::images/qtplasmac_conversational.png[width=900,align="center"]

The Conversational tab enables the user to quickly program various simple shapes for quick cutting without the need for CAM software.

See <<qt_shape-library, Conversational Shape Library>> for detailed information on the Conversational feature.

It is possible to disable this tab so the conversational feature cannot be used by an operator. This may be achieved either by wiring the pin to a physical key-switch or similar or it may also be set in a HAL file using the following command:

----
setp qtplasmac.conv_disable 1
----

[[qt_parameters-tab]]

=== PARAMETERS Tab

Screenshot example of the QtPlasmaC PARAMETERS tab in *16:9* aspect ratio:

image::images/qtplasmac_parameters.png[width=900,align="center"]

Some functions/features are only used for particular modes and are not displayed if they are not required by the chosen QtPlasmaC mode.

Due to space constraints, the 4x3 GUI's PARAMETERS tab will be spread across two tabs, PARAMETERS and SETTINGS.

This tab is used to display configuration parameters that are modified infrequently.

It is possible to disable this tab so machine settings cannot be modified by unauthorized personnel. This may be achieved either by wiring the pin to a physical key-switch or similar or it may also be set in a HAL file using the following command:

----
setp qtplasmac.param_disable 1

|*Name*|*Modes*|*Description*
|Start Fail Timer|0, 1, 2|This sets the amount of time (in seconds) QtPlasmaC will wait between commanding a "Torch On" and receiving an Arc OK signal before timing out and displaying an error message.
|Max Starts|0, 1, 2|This sets the number of times QtPlasmaC will attempt to start the arc.
|Retry Delay|0, 1, 2|This sets the time (in seconds) between an arc failure and another arc start attempt.
|Voltage Scale|0, 1|This sets the arc voltage input scale and is used to display the correct arc voltage. +
					For initial setup, see <<qt_calibration-values, Calibration Values>>.
|Voltage Offset|0, 1|This sets the arc voltage offset and is used to display zero volts when there is zero arc voltage input. +
                    For initial setup, see <<qt_calibration-values, Calibration Values>>.

|OK High Volts|0|This sets the voltage threshold below which Arc OK signal is valid.
|OK Low Volts|0|This sets the voltage threshold above which the Arc OK signal is valid.
|===

NOTE: When setting the OK Low Volts and OK High Volts in Mode 0, the cut voltage of a stable arc must be greater than the OK Low Volts value but lower than the OK High Volts value for QtPlasmaC to receive a valid Arc OK signal. To further clarify, to have a valid Arc OK, the arc voltage must fall between the two limits.

[underline]*PLASMAC CONFIGURATION - PROBING*

[width="100%",cols="4,16"]
|===

|Float Travel|This sets the amount of travel the float switch moves before completing the float switch circuit. This distance can be measured by using the Probe Test button, and the method described in <<qt_initial-setup, Initial Setup>>.
|Probe Speed|This sets the speed at which the torch will probe to find the material after it moves to the Probe Height.
|Probe Height|This sets the height above the Z axis minimum limit that Probe Speed begins.
|Ohmic Offset|This sets the distance above the material the torch will should go after a successful ohmic probe. It is mainly used to compensate for high probing speeds.
|Ohmic Retries|This sets the number of times QtPlasmaC will retry a failed ohmic probe before falling back to the float switch for material detection.
|Skip IHS|This sets the distance threshold used to determine if an Initial Height Sense (probe) can be skipped for the current cut, see <<qt_ihs-skip, IHS Skip>>.
|===

NOTE: If the amount of time between the torch contacting the material and when the torch moves up and comes to rest at the Pierce Height seems excessive, see <<qt_probing, the probing section>> for a possible solution.

[underline]*PLASMAC CONFIGURATION - SAFETY*

[underline]*PLASMAC CONFIGURATION - MOTION*

[width="100%",cols="4,16"]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*
|Max. Speed|Displays the maximum velocity the Z axis is capable of (this is controlled by the <machine_name>.ini file).
|Setup Speed|The Z axis velocity for setup moves (movements to Probe Height, Pierce Height, Cut Height, etc).
|===

NOTE: Setup Speed has no effect on THC speed which is capable of the velocity displayed in the Max. Speed field.

[underline]*PLASMAC CONFIGURATION - THC*

[width="100%",cols="4,2,14"]
|===
|*Name*|*Modes*|*Description*
|Delay|0, 1, 2|This sets the delay (in seconds) measured from the time the Arc OK signal is received until Torch Height Controller (THC) activates.
|Threshold|0, 1, 2|This sets the voltage variation allowed from the target voltage before for THC makes movements to correct the torch height.
|Speed (PID-P)|0, 1|This sets the Proportional gain for the THC PID loop. This roughly equates to how quickly the THC attempts to correct changes in height.
|VAD Threshold|0, 1|(Velocity Anti Dive) This sets the percentage of the current cut feed rate the machine can slow to before locking the THC to prevent torch dive.
|Void Override|0, 1|This sets the size of the change in cut voltage necessary to lock the THC to prevent torch dive (higher values need greater voltage change to lock THC).
|PID-I|0, 1|This sets the Integral gain for the THC PID loop. Integral gain is associated with the sum of errors in the system over time and is not always needed.
|PID-D|0, 1|This sets the Derivative gain for the THC PID loop. Derivative gain works to dampen the system and reduce over correction oscillations and is not always needed.
|===

NOTE: PID loop tuning is a complicated process and is outside the scope of this User Guide. There are many sources of information available to assist with understanding and tuning PID loops. If the THC is not making corrections fast enough, it is recommended to increase the P gain in small increments until the system operates favorably. Large P gain adjustments can result in over correction and oscillations.

[underline]*UTILITIES*

[[qt_backup]]

The **BACKUP CONFIG** button will create a complete machine configuration backup for archiving or to aid in fault diagnosis. A compressed backup of the machine configuration will be saved in the user's Linux home directory. The file name will be <machine_name>_<version_info>.tar.gz where <machine_name> is the machine name entered in the qtplasmac-setup program, and <version_info> is the current QtPlasmaC version the user is on.

=== STATISTICS Tab

The statistics tab provides statistics to allow for the tracking of consumable wear and job run times.

These statistics are shown for the current job as well as the running total.

Previous job statistics are reset once the next program is run.

The total values may be reset either individually by clicking the corresponding "RESET" button, or they may all be reset together by clicking "RESET ALL".

image::images/qtplasmac_stats.png[width=900,align="center"]

== Using QtPlasmaC

Once QtPlasmaC is successfully installed, no Z axis motion is required to be part of the G-Code cut program. In fact, if any Z axis references are present in the cut program, the standard QtPlasmaC configuration will remove them during the program loading process.

For reliable use of QtPlasmaC the user should *NOT* use any Z axis offsets other than the coordinate system offsets (G54-G59.3).

QtPlasmaC will automatically add a line of G-Code to move the Z axis to the correct height at the beginning of every G-Code program.

*Version Information* - QtPlasmaC will display versioning information in the title of the main window. The information will be displayed as followed "QtPlasmaC vX.X.XX - powered by QtVCP on LinuxCNC vY.Y.Y" where X.X.XX is the version of QtPlasmaC and Y.Y.Y is the version of LinuxCNC.

=== Mandatory Codes

Aside from the preamble code, postamble code, and X/Y motion code, the only mandatory G-Code syntax for QtPlasmaC to run a G-Code program is *M3 $0 S1* to begin a cut and *M5 $0* to end a cut.

If the user is using QtPlasmaC without <<qt_multi-tool, multiple tools>> enabled then it is permissible to use *M3 S1* in lieu of *M3 $0 S1* to begin a cutting job and *M5* in lieu of *M5 $0*.

=== Coordinates

See <<qt_z-settings, recommended Z axis>> settings.

Each time LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) is started Joint homing is required. This allows LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) to establish the known coordinates of each axis and set the soft limits to the values specified in the <machine_name>.ini file in order to prevent the machine from crashing into a hard stop during normal use.

If the machine does not have home switches then the user needs to ensure that all axes are at the home coordinates specified in the <machine_name>.ini file before homing.

If the machine has home switches then it will move to the specified home coordinates when the Joints are homed.

Depending on the machine's configuration there will either be a *Home All* button or each axis will need to be homed individually. Use the appropriate button/buttons to home the machine.

As mentioned in the <<qt_initial-setup, Initial Setup>> section, it is recommended that the first time QtPlasmaC is used that the user ensure there is nothing below the torch then jog the Z axis down until it stops at the Z axis MINIMUM_LIMIT then click *Touch Off* with the Z axis selected to set the Z axis at zero offset. This should not need to be done again.

If the user intends to place the material in the exact same place on the table every time, the user could jog the X and Y axes to the machine to the corresponding X0 Y0 position as established by the CAM software and then *Touch Off* both axes with a zero offset.

If the user intends to place the material randomly on the table then the user must *Touch Off* the X and Y axes at the appropriate position before starting the program.

[[qt_camera]]

=== CAMERA

image::images/qtplasmac_camview.png[width=900,align="center"]

QtPlasmaC has the ability to use a USB camera to set the origin with or without rotation compensation. The CAMERA button will be enabled after the machine is homed.

To use this feature, the user must set the camera's offset from the torch center line in the <machine_name>.ini file. This offset may be set manually by editing the ini file, or the user may use the configurator in <<qt_modify-config, reconfigure>> mode to add the offsets.

To add or modify the offsets manually, the user would add or edit the following line in the [QTPLASMAC] section:

----
CAMERA_TOUCHOFF = Xoffset Yoffset
----

"offset" is distance from the center line of the torch to the camera's cross hairs. Offsets could be specified as x25.4, X25.4, or 25.4.

*To set the origin with zero rotation:*

. Jog until the cross hairs are on top of the desired origin point.
. Press *MARK EDGE*. The *MARK EDGE* button label will change to *SET ORIGIN* and the *GOTO ORIGIN* button will be disabled.
. Press *SET ORIGIN*. The *SET ORIGIN* button label will change to *MARK EDGE* and the *GOTO ORIGIN* button will be enabled.
. The offset is now successful set.

*To set the origin with rotation:*

. Jog until the cross hairs are at the edge of the material a suitable distance away from the desired origin point.
. Press *MARK EDGE*. The *MARK EDGE* button label will change to *SET ORIGIN* and the *GOTO ORIGIN* button will be disabled.
. Jog until the cross hairs are at the origin point of the material.
. Press *SET ORIGIN*. The *SET ORIGIN* button label will change to *MARK EDGE* and the *GOTO ORIGIN* button will be enabled.
. The offset is now successfully set.

In the CAMVIEW panel, the mouse can effect the cross hairs and the zoom level as follows:

* Mouse Wheel Scroll - Change cross hair diameter.
* Mouse Wheel Button Double Click - Restores cross hair diameter to default.
* Mouse Left Button Clicked + Wheel Scroll - Changes camera zoom level.
* Mouse Left Button Clicked + Wheel Button Double Click - Restores default camera zoom level.

[[qt_laser]]

=== LASER

QtPlasmaC has the ability to use a laser to set the origin with or without rotation compensation. The LASER button will be enabled after the machine is homed.

To use this feature, the user must set the laser's offset from the torch center line in the <machine_name>.ini file. This offset may be set manually by editing the ini file, or the user may use the configurator in <<qt_modify-config, reconfigure>> mode to add the offsets.

To add or modify the offsets manually, the user would add or edit the following line in the [QTPLASMAC] section:

----
LASER_TOUCHOFF = Xoffset Yoffset
----

"offset" is distance from the center line of the torch to the camera's cross hairs. Offsets could be specified as x25.4, X25.4, or 25.4.

Additionally, the laser can be tied to any available output to turn the laser on and off via a HAL pin with the following name:

----
qtplasmac.laser_on
----

*To set the origin with zero rotation:*

. Press the *LASER* button.
. *LASER* button label will change to *MARK EDGE* and the HAL pin named qtplasmac.laser_on will be turned on.
. Jog until the laser cross hairs are on top of the desired origin point.
. Press *MARK EDGE*. The *MARK EDGE* button label will change to *SET ORIGIN*.
. Press *SET ORIGIN*. The *SET ORIGIN* button label will change to *MARK EDGE* and the HAL pin named qtplasmac.laser_on will be turned off.
. The offset is now successful set.

*To set the origin with rotation:*

. Press the *LASER* button.
. *LASER* button label will change to *MARK EDGE* and the HAL pin named qtplasmac.laser_on will be turned on.
. Jog until the laser cross hairs are at the edge of the material a suitable distance away from the desired origin point.
. Press *MARK EDGE*. The *MARK EDGE* button label will change to *SET ORIGIN*.
. Jog until the laser cross hairs are at the origin point of the material.
. Press *SET ORIGIN*. The *SET ORIGIN* button label will change to *MARK EDGE* and the HAL pin named qtplasmac.laser_on will be turned off.
. The offset is now successfully set.

[[qt_path-tolerance]]

=== Path Tolerance

The provided <<qt_rs274, RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE>> files: metric_startup.ngc and imperial_startup.ngc set the motion blending path tolerance with a G64 command P value to 0.1mm and 0.004" respectively. The P value corresponds to the amount the actual cut path followed by the machine may deviated from the programmed cut path before reducing velocity. If LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) receives an E-stop signal at any stage, the path tolerance will be set to the default (no P value) which will maintain the best possible speed and round corners off as a result. To prevent this, it is recommended that the path tolerance is set by placing the appropriate G64 command and P value in the header of each G-Code file.

For Metric:
----
G64 P0.1
----

For Imperial:
----
G64 P0.004
----

[[qt_paused-motion]]

=== Paused Motion

QtPlasmaC has the ability to allow the repositioning of the X and Y axes along the current cut path while the G-Code program is paused.

In order to use this feature, LinuxCNC's Adaptive Feed Control (M52) must be turned on (P1).

To enable *Paused Motion* The preamble of the G-Code must contain the following line:

----
M52 P1
----

To turn off *Paused Motion* at any point, use the following command:

----
M52 P0
----

[[qt_pause-at-end]]

=== Pause At End Of Cut

This feature can be used to allow the arc to "catch up" to the torch position to fully finish the cut. It is usually required for thicker materials and is especially useful when cutting stainless steel.

Using this feature will cause all motion to pause at the end of the cut while the torch is still on. After the dwell time (in seconds) set by the *Pause At End* parameter in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> has expired, QtPlasmaC will proceed with the M5 command to turn off and raise the torch.

[[qt_multi-tool]]

=== Multiple Tools

QtPlasmaC has the ability to allow the use of more than one tool when running a cut program. Multiple tools must be enabled in QtPlasmaC before they can be used. Valid tools are:

* Plasma Torch - Used for normal Plasma cutting.
* Scribe - Used for material engraving.
* Plasma Torch - Used for spotting (creating dimples to aid in drilling).

If multiple tools are enabled then a LinuxCNC tool number (designated by $n) is required to be in the *M3* command to select the correct tool to be used. Examples:

* *M3 $0 S1* will select and start the plasma cutting tool.
* *M3 $1 S1* will select and start the scribe.
* *M3 $2 S1* will select and the plasma spotting tool.

To enable the multiple tools feature the user will need to edit the following line in the <machine_name>_connections.hal file.

from:

----
setp plasmac.multi-tool 0
----

to:

----
setp plasmac.multi-tool 1
----

In order to use multiple tools with a scribe, it is necessary for the user to add the X and Y axis offsets to the LinuxCNC tool table. The tool.tbl file is found in the <machine_name> config folder. Tool 0 is assigned to the Plasma Torch and Tool 1 is assigned to the scribe. Tools are selected with a *Tn M6* command, and then a *G43 H0* command is required to apply the offsets for the selected tool. It is important to note that the LinuxCNC tool table and tool commands only come into play if the user is using a <<qt_scribe, scribe>> in addition to a plasma torch. For more information, see <<qt_scribe, scribe>>.

[[qt_velocity-reduction]]

=== Velocity Reduction

There is a HAL pin available named *motion.analog-out-03* that can be changed in G-Code with the *M67 (Synchronized with Motion)/M68 (Immediate)* commands. This pin will reduce the velocity to the percentage specified in the command.

It is important to thoroughly understand the difference between *Synchronized with Motion* and *Immediate*:

* *M67* (Synchronized with Motion) - The actual change of the specified output (P2 (THC) for example) will happen at the beginning of the next motion command. If there is no subsequent motion command, the output changes will not occur. It is best practice to program a motion code (G0 or G1 for example) right after a M67.
* *M68* (Immediate) - These commands happen immediately as they are received by the motion controller. Since these are not synchronized with motion, they will break blending. This means if these codes are used in the middle of active motion codes, the motion will pause to activate these commands.

Examples:

* *M67 E3 Q0* would set the velocity to 100% of *CutFeedRate*.
* *M67 E3 Q40* would set the velocity to 40% of *CutFeedRate*.
* *M67 E3 Q60* would set the velocity to 60% of *CutFeedRate*.
* *M67 E3 Q100* would set the velocity to 100% of *CutFeedRate*.

The minimum percentage allowed is 10%, values below this will be set to 10%.

The maximum percentage allowed is 100%, values above this will be set to 100%.

If the user intends to use this feature it would be prudent to add *M68 E3 Q0* to both the preamble and postamble of the G-Code program so the machine starts and ends in a known state.

TIP: Another way of achieving the same result is to use *F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>* with a multiplier.

For example:

----
F[#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> * 0.6]
----

IMPORTANT: *G-CODE THC* AND *VELOCITY BASED THC* ARE NOT ABLE TO BE USED IF *CUTTER COMPENSATION* IS IN EFFECT; AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED.

WARNING: If Cut Feed Rate in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> is set to Zero then QtPlasmaC will use *motion.requested-velocity* (as set by a standard Feedrate call in the G-Code) for the THC calculations. This is not recommended as it is not a reliable way of implementing velocity based THC.

NOTE: All references to CutFeedRate refer to the *Cut Feed Rate* value displayed in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

[[qt_material-handling]]

=== Material File

Material handling uses a material file that was created for the machine configuration when the qtplasmac-setup program was ran and allows the user to conveniently store known material settings for easy recall either manually or automatically via G Code. The resulting <<qt_material-file, material file>> is named *<machine_name>_material.cfg*.

QtPlasmaC does not require the use of a material file. Instead, the user could change the cut parameters manually from the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>. It is also not required to use the automatic material changes. If the user does not wish to use this feature they can simply omit the material change codes from the G-Code file.

[[qt_material-file]]

Material numbers in the materials file do not need to be consecutive nor do they need to be in numerical order.

The following variables are mandatory and an error message will appear if any are not found when the material file is loaded.

* PIERCE_HEIGHT
* PIERCE_DELAY
* CUT_HEIGHT
* CUT_SPEED

The following variables are optional. If they are not detected or have no value assigned, they will be assigned a value of 0 and no error message will appear.

* NAME
* KERF_WIDTH
* THC
* PUDDLE_JUMP_HEIGHT
* PUDDLE_JUMP_DELAY
* CUT_AMPS
* CUT_VOLTS
* PAUSE_AT_END
* GAS_PRESSURE
* CUT_MODE

WARNING: It is the responsibility of the operator to ensure that the variables are included if they are a requirement for the G-Code to be run.

The material file uses the following format:

----
[MATERIAL_NUMBER_1]
NAME                = name
KERF_WIDTH          = value
THC                 = value (0 = off, 1 = on)
PIERCE_HEIGHT       = value
PIERCE_DELAY        = value
PUDDLE_JUMP_HEIGHT  = value
PUDDLE_JUMP_DELAY   = value
CUT_HEIGHT          = value
CUT_SPEED           = value
CUT_AMPS            = value (for info only unless PowerMax communications is enabled)
CUT_VOLTS           = value (modes 0 & 1 only, if not using auto voltage sampling)
PAUSE_AT_END        = value
GAS_PRESSURE        = value (only used for PowerMax communications)
CUT_MODE            = value (only used for PowerMax communications)
----

It is possible to add new material, delete material, or edit existing material from the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS tab.>> It is also possible to achieve this by using <<qt_magic-comments, magic comments>> in a g-Code file.

The material file may be edited with a text editor while LinuxCNC is running. After any changes have been saved, press *Reload* in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> to reload the material file.

=== Manual Material Handling

For manual material handling, the user would manually select the material from the materials list in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> before starting the G-Code program. In addition to selecting materials with materials list in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>, the user could use the MDI to change materials with the following command:

----
M190 Pn
----

The following code is the minimum code necessary to have a successful cut using the manual material selection method:

----
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>
M3 $0 S1
.
.
M5 $0
----

NOTE: Manual material handling will restrict the user to only one material for the entire job.

=== Automatic Material Handling

For automatic material handling, the user would add commands to their G-Code file which will enable QtPlasmaC to change the material automatically.

The following codes may be used to allow QtPlasmaC to automatically change materials:

* *M190 Pn* - Changes the currently displayed material to material number n.
* *M66 P3 L3 Q1* - Adds a small delay (1 second in this example) to wait for QtPlasmaC to confirm that it successfully changed materials.
* *F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>* - Sets the cut feed rate to the feed rate shown in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

For automatic material handling, the codes MUST be applied in the order shown. If a G-Code program is loaded which contains one or more material change commands then the first material will be displayed in the top header of the PREVIEW WINDOW on the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>> as the program is loading. The following code is the minimum code necessary to have a successful cut using the automatic material selection method:

----
M190 Pn
M66 P3 L3 Q1
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>
M3 $0 S1
.
.
M5 $0
----

=== Material Converter

This application is used to convert existing tool tables into QtPlasmaC material files. It can also create a material file from manual user input to entry fields.

At this stage the only conversions available are for tool tables exported from either SheetCam or Fusion360.

SheetCam tool tables are complete and the conversion is fully automatic. The SheetCam tool file must be in the SheetCam .tools format.

Fusion360 tool tables do not have all of the required fields so the user will be prompted for missing parameters. The Fusion360 tool file must be in the Fusion360 .json format.

If the user has a format from a different CAM software they would like converted, create a *New Topic* in the https://forum.linuxcnc.org/plasmac[PlasmaC forum] section of the https://forum.linuxcnc.org/[LinuxCNC forum] to request this addition.

Material Converter may be run from a terminal using one of the two following methods.

For a package installation (Buildbot) enter the following command in a terminal window:

----
qtplasmac-materials
----

For a run in place installation enter the following two commands in a terminal window:

----
source ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/rip-environment
qtplasmac-materials
----

This will bring up the Material Converter Main dialog with Manual selected as the default.

Select one of:

* *Manual* - to manually create a new material file.

image::images/qtplasmac_material_main_manual.png[width=350,align="center"]

* *SheetCam* - to convert a SheetCam tool file.

image::images/qtplasmac_material_main_sheetcam.png[width=350,align="center"]

For SheetCam only, select whether the user requires a metric or imperial output file.

* *Fusion360* - to convert a Fusion360 tool file.

image::images/qtplasmac_material_main_fusion360.png[width=350,align="center"]

To convert:

. Select the Input File to be converted, press Input to bring up a file selector or directly enter the file in the entry box.
. Select the Output File to write to, press Output to bring up a file selector or directly enter the file in the entry box. This would normally be ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine_name>_material.cfg. If necessary, the user could select a different file and hand edit the <machine_name>_material.cfg file.
. Click Create/Convert and the new material file will be created.

For both a Manual creation or a Fusion360 conversion, a dialog will show with all available parameters displayed for input. Any entry marked with pass:[***] is mandatory and all other entries are optional depending on the user's configuration needs.

image::images/qtplasmac_material_manual_dialog.png[width=150,align="center"]

NOTE: If the user selects ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine_name>_material.cfg and the file already exists, it will be overwritten.

[[qt_magic-comments]]

=== Magic G-Code Comments

* *Keep Z Motion*

By default, QtPlasmaC will remove all Z motion from a loaded G-Code file and add an initial Z movement to bring the torch near the top of travel at the beginning of the file. If the user wishes to use their table with a marker, a drag knife, diamond scribe, etc. mounted in the torch holder, QtPlasmaC has the ability to retain the Z movements in a G-Code file via the following magic comment:

----
  #<keep-z-motion> = 1
----

Omitting this magic comment, or setting this value to anything but 1 will cause QtPlasmaC to revert to the default behavior of stripping all Z motion from a loaded G-Code file and making an initial Z movement to bring the torch near the top of travel at the beginning of the file.

* *Materials Adding And Editing Via G-Code*

It is possible to add new materials or edit existing materials by using "magic comments" in a G-Code file.

Formatting rules are:

- The entire comment must be in parentheses.
- The beginning of the magic comment must be: *(o=*
- The equals sign must immediately follow each parameter with no space.
- The mandatory parameters must be in the magic comment (*nu* and *na* are not required for option 0).
- There can be any number and type of magic comments in a G-Code file with the exception of option 0. If more than one option 0 comment is found in the G-Code file then only the last one found will be used.
- If option 0 is to be used in addition to option 1 and/or option 2 then the option 0 comment must be the last one in the G-Code file.

The options are:

[width="75%",cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Option*|*Description*
|0|Creates a temporary default material. +
     Material information added with this option will be discarded by a manual reload or a LinuxCNC restart.
|1|Adds a new material if the number specified does not exist.
|2|Overwrites an existing material if the number specified exists. +
     Adds a new material if the number specified does not exist.
|===

Mandatory parameters are:

[width="75%",cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*
|o|Selects the option to be used.
|nu|Sets the material number (not required for option 0).
|na|Sets the material name (not required for option 0).
|ph|Sets the pierce height.
|pd|Sets the pierce delay.
|ch|Sets the cut height.
|fr|Sets the feed rate.
|===

Optional parameters are:

[width="75%",cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*
|kw|Sets the kerf width.
|th|Sets the THC status (0=disabled, 1=enabled).
|ca|Sets the cut amps.
|cv|Sets the cut voltage.
|pe|Sets the pause at end delay.
|gp|Sets the gas pressure (PowerMax).
|cm|Sets the cut mode (PowerMax).
|jh|Sets the puddle jump height.
|jd|Sets the puddle jump delay.
|===

A complete example:

----
(o=1, nu=2, na=5mm Mild Steel 40A, ph=3.1, pd=0.1, ch=0.75, fr=3000, kw=0.5, th=1, ca=45, cv=110, pe=0.1, gp=5, cm=1, jh=0, jd=0)
----

[[qt_thc]]

=== THC (Torch Height Controller)

The THC can be enabled or disabled from the THC frame of the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>.

The THC can also be enabled or disabled directly from the G-Code program.

QtPlasmaC uses a control voltage which is dependent on the state of the *AUTO VOLTS* checkbox on the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>:

. If *Use Auto Volts* is checked then the actual cut voltage is sampled after the cut begins. To allow the arc voltage to stabilize, QtPlasmaC waits for the amount of time displayed in the *Delay* field in the THC section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> before sampling the voltage. The sampled voltage is then used as the target voltage to adjust the height of the torch.
. If *Use Auto Volts* is not checked then the voltage displayed as Cut Volts in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> is used as the target voltage to adjust the height of the torch.

The THC does not become active until the velocity reaches 99.9% of the *CutFeedRate*.

[underline]*G-Code THC*

THC may be disabled and enabled directly from G-Code, provided the THC is not disabled in the THC Section of the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>, by setting or resetting the *motion.digital-out-02* pin with the M-Codes M62-M65:

* *M62 P2* will disable THC (Synchronized with Motion)
* *M63 P2* will enable THC (Synchronized with Motion)
* *M64 P2* will disable THC (Immediately)
* *M65 P2* will enable THC (Immediately)

It is important to thoroughly understand the difference between *Synchronized with Motion* and *Immediate*:

* *M62 and M63* (Synchronized with Motion) - The actual change of the specified output (P2 (THC) for example) will happen at the beginning of the next motion command. If there is no subsequent motion command, the output changes will not occur. It is best practice to program a motion code (G0 or G1 for example) right after a M62 or M63.
* *M64 and M65* (Immediate) - These commands happen immediately as they are received by the motion controller. Since these are not synchronized with motion, they will break blending. This means if these codes are used in the middle of active motion codes, the motion will pause to activate these commands.

[[qt_velocity_thc]]

[underline]*Velocity Based THC*

If the cut velocity falls below a percentage of *CutFeedRate* (as defined by the VAD Threshold % value in the THC frame of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>) the THC will be locked until the cut velocity returns to at least 99.9% of *CutFeedRate*. This will be made apparent by the *THC Velocity Lock* indicator illuminating in the <<qt_control-panel, CONTROL Panel>> on the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>.

Velocity based THC prevents the torch height being changed when velocity is reduced for a sharp corner or a small hole.

It is important to note that <<qt_velocity-reduction, Velocity Reduction>> affects the Velocity Based THC in the following ways:

. If Velocity Reduction is invoked in the middle of the cut, the THC will be locked.
. The THC will remain locked until the velocity reduction is canceled by returning it to a value that is above the *VAD Threshold*, and the torch actually reaches 99.9% of the *CutFeedRate*.

[[qt_cutter-compensation]]

=== Cutter Compensation

LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) has the ability to automatically adjust the cut path of the current program by the amount specified in Kerf Width of the selected material's Cut Parameters. This is helpful if the G-Code is programmed to the nominal cut path and the user will be running the program on different thickness materials to help ensure consistently sized parts.

To use cutter compensation the user will need to use G41.1, G42.1 and G40 with the kerf width HAL pin:

* *G41.1 D#<_hal[plasmac_run.kerf-width-f]>* : offsets torch to the left of the programmed path
* *G42.1 D#<_hal[plasmac_run.kerf-width-f]>* : offsets torch to the right of the programmed path
* *G40* turns the cutter compensation off

IMPORTANT: IF *CUTTER COMPENSATION* IS IN EFFECT *G-CODE THC*, *VELOCITY BASED THC* AND *OVERCUT* ARE NOT ABLE TO BE USED; AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED.

[[qt_ihs-skip]]

=== Initial Height Sense (IHS) Skip

IHS may be skipped in one of two different ways:

. If the THC is disabled then the IHS skip will occur if the start of the cut is less than *Skip IHS* distance from the last successful probe.

. If the THC is enabled then the IHS skip will occur if the start of the cut is less than *Skip IHS* distance from the end of the last cut.

A value of zero for *Skip IHS* will disable IHS skipping.

Any errors encountered during a cut will disable IHS skipping for the next cut if *Skip IHS* is enabled.

[[qt_probing]]

=== Probing

Probing may be done with either ohmic sensing or a float switch. It is also possible to combine the two methods, in which case the float switch will provide a fallback to ohmic probing.

If the machine's torch does not support ohmic probing, the user could have a separate probe next to the torch. In this case the user would extend the probe below the torch. The probe must NOT extend more than the minimum Cut Height below the torch and the Z axis offset distance needs to be entered as the *Ohmic Offset* in the PROBING frame of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

Probing setup is done in the PROBING frame of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>. Probing speed is controlled of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

QtPlasmaC can probe at the full Z axis velocity so long as the machine has enough movement in the float switch to absorb any overrun. If the machine's float switch travel is suitable, the user could set the Probe Height to near the Z axis MINIMUM_LIMIT and do all probing at full speed.

Some float switches can exhibit a large switching hysteresis which shows up in the probing sequence as an excessive time to complete the final probe up.

 * This time may be decreased by changing the speed of the final probe up.
 * This speed defaults to 0.001mm (0.000039") per servo cycle.
 * It is possible to increase this speed by up to a factor of 10 by adding the following line to the <machine_name>_connections.hal file:

----
setp plasmac.probe-final-speed n
----

where n is a value from 1-10. It is recommended to keep this value as low as possible.

Using this feature will change the final height slightly and will require thorough probe testing to confirm the final height.

This speed value affects ALL probing so if the user uses ohmic probing and the user changes this speed value then the user will need to probe test to set the require offset to compensate for this speed change as well as the float travel.

The reliability of this feature will only be as good as the repeatability of the float switch.

NOTE: Probe Height refers to the height above the Z axis MINIMUM_LIMIT.

[[qt_cut-types]]

=== Cut Types

QtPlasmaC allows two different cut modes:

. *NORMAL CUT* - runs the loaded G-Code program to pierce then cut.
. *PIERCE ONLY* - converts the loaded G-Code program and then runs the program to pierce the material at the *M3 S1* or *M3 $0 S1* command positions only. Scribe (*M3 $1 S1*) and Spotting (*M3 $2 S1*) commands will be ignored and no pierce will take place in those locations.

*Pierce Only* mode is useful for thick materials which may produce enough dross on the material surface from piercing to interfere with the torch while cutting. This enables the entire sheet to be pierced and cleaned off before cutting.

This also enables near-end-of-life consumables to be used for piercing and then they can be swapped out for good consumables to be used while cutting.

There are two ways of enabling this feature:

. Utilize the default <<qt_button-cut, custom user button>> to toggle between the cut types.
. Adding the following line to the G-Code program before the first cut to enable *Pierce Only* mode for the current file:

----
#<pierce-only> = 1
----

If using a custom user button is utilized then QtPlasmaC will automatically reload the file when the cut type is toggled.

=== Hole Cutting - Intro

It is recommended that any holes to be cut have a diameter no less than one and a half times the thickness of the material to be cut.

It is also recommended that holes with a diameter of less than 32mm (1.26") are cut at 60% of the feed rate used for profile cuts. This should also lock out THC due to velocity constraints.

QtPlasmaC can utilize G-Code commands usually set by a CAM Post Processor (PP) to aid in hole cutting or if the user does not have a PP or the user's PP does not support these methods then QtPlasmaC can automatically adapt the G-Code to suit. This automatic mode is disabled by default.

There are three methods available for improving the quality of small holes:

. *Velocity Reduction* - <<qt_hole-cutting-velocity-reduction, Reducing the velocity>> to approximately 60% of the *CutFeedRate*.
. *Arc Dwell (<<qt_pause-at-end, Pause At End>>)* - Keeping the torch on for a short time at the end of the hole while motion is stopped to allow the arc to catch up.
. *Overcut* - Turning the torch off at the end of the hole then continue along the path.

NOTE: If both *Arc Dwell* and *Overcut* are active at the same time then *Overcut* will take precedence.

IMPORTANT: *OVERCUT* IS NOT ABLE TO BE USED IF CUTTER COMPENSATION IS IN EFFECT; AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED.


=== Hole Cutting

G-Code commands can be set up by either by a CAM Post Processor (PP) or by hand coding.

[[qt_hole-cutting-velocity-reduction]]

[underline]*Hole Cutting Velocity Reduction*

If cutting a hole requires a reduced velocity then the user would use the following command to set the velocity: *M67 E3 Qnn* where nn is the percentage of the velocity desired. For example, *M67 E3 Q60* would set the velocity to 60% of the current material's *CutFeedRate*.

See the <<qt_velocity_thc,Velocity Based THC>> section.

Sample code:

----
G21 (metric)
G64 P0.005
M52 P1 (allow paused motion)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> (feed rate from cut parameters)
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $0 S1 (start cut)
G1 X0
M67 E3 Q60 (reduce feed rate to 60%)
G3 I10 (the hole)
M67 E3 Q0 (restore feed rate to 100%)
M5 $0 (end cut)
G0 X0 Y0
M2 (end job)
----

[underline]*Arc Dwell (Pause At End)*

This method can be invoked by setting the <<qt_pause-at-end, Pause At End>> parameter in the MATERIAL frame of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

[[qt_overcut]]

[underline]*Overcut*

The torch can be turned off at the end of the hole by setting the *motion.digital-out-03* pin with the M-Codes *M62 (Synchronized with Motion)* or *M64 (Immediate)*. After turning the torch off it is necessary to allow the torch to be turned on again before beginning the next cut by resetting the *motion.digital-out-03* pin with the M-Codes *M63* or *M65*, this will be done automatically by the QtPlasmaC G-Code parser if it reaches an M5 command without seeing a *M63 P3* or *M65 P3*.

After the torch is turned off the hole path will be followed for a default length of 4mm (0.157"). This distance may be specified by adding *#<oclength> = n* to the G-Code file.

* *M62 P3* will turn the torch off (Synchronized with Motion)
* *M63 P3* will allow the torch to be turned on (Synchronized with Motion)
* *M64 P3* will turn the torch off (Immediately)
* *M65 P3* will allow the torch to be turned on (Immediately)

It is important to thoroughly understand the difference between *Synchronized with motion* and *Immediate*:

* *M62 and M63* (Synchronized with Motion) - The actual change of the specified output (P2 (THC) for example) will happen at the beginning of the next motion command. If there is no subsequent motion command, the output changes will not occur. It is best practice to program a motion code (G0 or G1 for example) right after a M62 or M63.
* *M64 and M65* (Immediate) - These commands happen immediately as they are received by the motion controller. Since these are not synchronized with motion, they will break blending. This means if these codes are used in the middle of active motion codes, the motion will pause to activate these commands.

Sample code:

----
G21 (metric)
G64 P0.005
M52 P1 (allow paused motion)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> (feed rate from cut parameters)
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $0 S1 (start cut)
G1 X0
M67 E3 Q60 (reduce feed rate to 60%)
G3 I10 (the hole)
M62 P3 (turn torch off)
G3 X0.8 Y6.081 I10 (continue motion for 4mm)
M63 P3 (allow torch to be turned on)
M67 E3 Q0 (restore feed rate to 100%)
M5 $0 (end cut)
G0 X0 Y0
M2 (end job)
----

[[qt_hole-cutting]]

=== Hole Cutting - Automatic

QtPlasmaC has the ability to automatically modify the G-Code to reduce the velocity and/or apply *Overcut* which can be useful when cutting holes.

The default hole size for QtPlasmaC hole sensing is 32mm (1.26"). It is possible to change this value with the following command in a G-Code file:

* *#<h_diameter> = nn* - To set a diameter (nn) in the same units system as the rest of the G-Code file.

The default velocity for QtPlasmaC small holes is 60% of the current feed rate. It is possible to change this value with the following command in a G-Code file:

* *#<h_velocity> = nn* - to set the percentage (nn) of the current feed rate required.

QtPlasmaC Hole Sensing is disabled by default. It can be enabled/disabled by using the following G-Code parameters to select the desired hole sensing mode:

* *#<holes> = 0* - Causes QtPlasmaC to disable hole sensing if it was previously enabled.
* *#<holes> = 1* - Causes QtPlasmaC to reduce the speed of holes less than 32mm (1.26") to 60% of *CutFeedRate*.
* *#<holes> = 2* - Causes QtPlasmaC to <<qt_overcut, Overcut>> the hole in addition to the velocity changes in setting 1.
* *#<holes> = 3* - Causes QtPlasmaC to reduce the speed of holes less than 32mm (1.26") and arcs less than 16mm (0.63") to 60% of *CutFeedRate*.
* *#<holes> = 4* - Causes QtPlasmaC to <<qt_overcut, Overcut>> the hole in addition to the velocity change in setting 3.

[underline]*Arc Dwell (Pause At End)*

This feature can be used in addition to setting the desired hole sensing mode via the appropriate G-Code parameter by setting the <<qt_pause-at-end, Pause At End>> parameter in the MATERIAL frame of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

[underline]*Overcut*

If Hole Sensing modes 2 or 4 are active, QtPlasmaC will overcut the hole in addition to the velocity changes associated with modes 1 and 3.

The default overcut length for QtPlasmaC hole sensing is 4mm (0.157"). It is possible to change this value with the following command in a G-Code file:

* *#<oclength> = nn* to specify an overcut length (nn) in the same units system as the rest of the G-Code file.

Sample code:

----
G21 (metric)
G64 P0.005
M52 P1 (allow paused motion)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> (feed rate from cut parameters)
#<holes> = 2 (overcut for holes)
#<oclength> = 6.5 (optional, 6.5mm overcut length)
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $0 S1 (start cut)
G1 X0
G3 I10 (the hole)
M5 $0 (end cut)
G0 X0 Y0
M2 (end job)
----

NOTE: It is OK to have multiple and mixed hole commands in a single G-Code file.

=== Single Cut

A single cut is a single unidirectional cutting move often used to cut a sheet into smaller pieces prior to running a G-Code program.

The machine needs to be homed before commencing a single cut.

A single cut will commence from the machine's current X/Y position.

[[qt_single-cut]]

[underline]*Automatic Single Cut*

This is the preferred method. The parameters for this method are entered in the following dialog box that is displayed after pressing a <<qt_button-single, user button>> which has been coded to run single cut:

image::images/qtplasmac_single_cut.png[width=300,align="center"]

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set required appropriate material, or edit the Feed Rate for the default material in the PARAMATERS tab. +
. Press the assigned single cut user button. +
. Enter the length of the cut along the X and/or Y axes. +
. Press the *START CUT* button and the cut will commence.

[underline]*Pendant Single Cut*

If the machine is equipped with a pendant that can start and stop the spindle plus jog the X and Y axes, the user can manually perform a single cut.

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set the required feed rate with the Jog Speed slider. +
. Start the cut process by starting the spindle. +
. After probing the torch will fire. +
. When the Arc OK is received the machine can be jogged along the cut line using the jog buttons. +
. When the cut is complete stop the spindle. +
. The torch will turn off and the Z axis will return to the starting position.

[underline]*Manual Single Cut*

Manual single cut requires that <<qt_keyboard-shortcuts, keyboard shortcuts>> are enable in the GUI SETTINGS section of the PARAMETERS Tab.

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set the required feed rate with the Jog Speed slider. +
. Start the procedure by pressing *F9*. +
. After probing the torch will fire. +
. When the Arc OK is received the machine can be jogged along the cut line using the jog keys. +
. When the cut is complete press *F9* or *Esc*. +
. The torch will turn off and the Z axis will return to the starting position.

NOTE: If the torch flames out during cutting, the user must still press *F9* or *Esc* to end the cut. This clears the Z offsets and returns the torch to the starting position.

[[qt_mesh-mode]]

=== Mesh Mode (Expanded Metal Cutting)

QtPlasmaC is capable of cutting of expand (mesh) metal provided the machine has a pilot arc torch and it is capable of Constant Pilot Arc (CPA) mode.

*Mesh Mode* disables the THC and also ignores a lost Arc OK signal during a cut. It can be selected by checking the *Mesh Mode* check button in the CONTROL section of the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>.

If the machine has <<qt_pm_comms, RS485>> communications enabled with a Hypertherm PowerMax plasma cutter, selecting *Mesh Mode* will automatically override the *Cut Mode* for the currently selected material and set it to cut mode 2 (CPA). When *Mesh Mode* is disabled, the *Cut Mode* will be return to the default cut mode for the currently selected material.

It is also possible to start a *Mesh Mode* cut without receiving an Arc OK signal by checking the *Ignore Arc OK* check button in the CONTROL section of the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>.

Both *Mesh Mode* and *Ignore Arc OK* can be enabled/disabled at any time during a job.

[[qt_ignore-ok]]

=== Ignore Arc OK

*Ignore Arc OK* mode disables the THC, will begin a cut without requiring an Arc OK signal, and will ignore a lost Arc OK signal during a cut.

This mode can be selected by:

. Checking the *Ignore Arc OK* check button in the CONTROL section of the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>. +
. Setting HAL pin *motion.digital-out-01* to 1 via G-Code.

* *M62 P1* will enable *Ignore Arc OK* (Synchronized with Motion)
* *M63 P1* will disable *Ignore Arc OK* (Synchronized with Motion)
* *M64 P1* will enable *Ignore Arc OK* (Immediately)
* *M65 P1* will disable *Ignore Arc OK* (Immediately)

It is important to thoroughly understand the difference between *Synchronized with motion* and *Immediate*:

* *M62 and M63* (Synchronized with Motion) - The actual change of the specified output (P2 (THC) for example) will happen at the beginning of the next motion command. If there is no subsequent motion command, the output changes will not occur. It is best practice to program a motion code (G0 or G1 for example) right after a M62 or M63.
* *M64 and M65* (Immediate) - These commands happen immediately as they are received by the motion controller. Since these are not synchronized with motion, they will break blending. This means if these codes are used in the middle of active motion codes, the motion will pause to activate these commands.

This mode may also be used in conjunction with *Mesh Mode* if the user doesn't require an Arc OK signal to begin the cut.

Both *Mesh Mode* and *Ignore Arc OK* can be enabled/disabled at any time during a job.

[[qt_cut-recovery]]

=== Cut Recovery

image::images/qtplasmac_cut_recovery.png[width=250,align="center"]

This feature will produce a dialog box that will allow the torch to be moved away from the cut path during a <<qt_paused-motion, paused motion>> event in order to position the torch over a scrap portion of the material being cut so that the cut restarts with a minimized arc-divot. This feature is only available from a user-programmed button (named Cut-Recovery by default) in the Extras panel and may only be clicked while motion is paused.

It is preferable to make torch position adjustments from the point at which paused motion occurred, however if moving along the cut path is necessary prior to setting the new start point, the user may use the paused motion controls (Rev, Fwd, and a jog-speed slider) at the top of the dialog box. Once the user is satisfied with the positioning of the torch along the cut path, moving off the cut path is achieved by pressing the direction buttons. Each press of the direction button will move the torch a distance equivalent to the *Kerf Width* parameter of the currently selected material.

The moment the torch has been moved off the cut path, the paused motion controls (Rev, Fwd, and a jog-speed slider) at the top of the dialog box will become disabled.

Once the torch position is satisfactory, press Resume Cut or the GUI’s Resume button (Pause symbol) and the cut will resume from the new position and travel the shortest distance to the original paused motion location. The dialog box will close when the torch returns to the original paused motion location.

Pressing Cancel (or the X in the title bar) will cause the torch to move back to where it was positioned when the motion became paused and the dialog box will close.

[[qt_run-from-line]]

=== Run From Line

If the user has the Run From Line option enabled in the GUI SETTINGS section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> they will have the ability to start from any line in a G Code program via the following methods:

. Clicking any line in the Preview Window
. Clicking any line in the G-Code Window

It is important to note that G Code programs can be run from any selected line using this method, however a leadin may not be possible depending on the line selected. In this case, an error message will be displayed to let the user know the leadin calculation was not possible.

Once the user has selected the starting place, the CYCLE START button will blink "SELECTED nn" where nn is the corresponding line number selected. Clicking this button will bring up the following Run From Line dialog box:

image::images/qtplasmac_run_from_line.png[width=350,align="center"]

[width="100%",cols="4,16"]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*
|USE LEADIN|This radio button will allow the user to start the selected line with a leadin.
|LEADIN LENGTH|If USE LEADIN is selected, this will set the length of the lead in the machine units.
|USE LEADIN|If USE LEADIN is selected, this will set the angle of approach for the leadin. +
            The angle is measured such that positive increases in value move the leadin counter-clockwise: +
            0 Degrees = 3 o'clock position +
            90 Degrees = 12 o'clock position +
            180 Degrees = 9 o'clock position +
            270 Degrees = 6 o'clock position
|CANCEL|This button will cancel the Run From Line dialog box and any selections.
|LOAD|This button will load a temporary "rfl.ngc" program with any selected leadin parameters applied. +
        If the leadin cannot be calculated for the selected line, the following error message will be displayed: +
        "Unable to calculate a leadin for this cut +
        Program will run from selected line with no leadin applied"
|===

After pressing LOAD, the blinking "SELECTED nn" button will change to a blinking "RUN FROM nn" button. Click this button to start the program from the previously selected line.

*Run From Line selections may be canceled in the following ways:*

. Click the background of the preview window - this method will cancel a selection of either a cut line in the preview window, or a G Code line in the G Code window.
. Clicking RELOAD - this method will cancel the Run From Line process if LOAD was clicked on the Run From Line dialog box and "rfl.ngc" is displayed as the loaded file name in the G Code window header. This will return the user to the originally loaded file.

[[qt_scribe]]

=== Scribe

A scribe may be operated by QtPlasmaC in addition to the plasma torch. This ability is disabled by default so as not to adversely affect existing configurations. To enable scribing, see the <<qt_multi-tool, Multiple Tools>> section for guidance in editing the <machine_name>_connections.hal file.

Using a scribe requires the use of the LinuxCNC tool table. Tool 0 is assigned to the plasma torch and Tool 1 is assigned to the scribe. The scribe X and Y axes offsets from the plasma torch need to be entered into the LinuxCNC tool table. This is done by editing the tool table via the main GUI, or by editing the *tool.tbl* file in the *<machine_name>* configuration directory. This will be done after the scribe can move to the work piece to help determine the appropriate offset.

The plasma torch offsets for X and Y will always be zero. The tools are selected by the *Tn M6* command followed by a *G43 H0* command which is required to apply the offsets. The tool is then started with a *M3 $n S1* command. For *n*, use 0 for torch cutting or 1 for scribing.

If the user has not yet assigned the HAL pins for the scribe in the qtplasmac-setup program then they will need to do so by invoking the <<qt_modify-config, reconfigure>> mode of the qtplasmac-setup program.

There are two HAL output pins used to operate the scribe, the first pin is used to arm the scribe which moves the scribe to the surface of the material. After the <<qt_scribe-config, Arm Delay>> has elapsed, the second pin is used to start the scribe. After the <<qt_scribe-config, On Delay>> has elapsed, motion will begin.

Using QtPlasmaC after enabling the scribe requires the selection of either the torch or the scribe in each G-Code file as a LinuxCNC tool.

The next step is to open the tool table editor in the GUI or edit *tool.tbl* in the *<machine_name>* configuration directory and enter the X and Y axes offsets. These are the distances in X and Y the scribe is away from the torch as measured from the center of the torch nozzle. In most cases, if the user is standing at the front of the machine and the scribe is to the right of the torch, a positive X offset would be required. Similarly, if the scribe is to the rear of the torch, a positive Y offset would be required. The offsets for the torch should always be zero.

The final step is to set the <<qt_scribe-config, scribe delays>> required:

. *Arm Delay* - allows time for the scribe to descend to the surface of the material.
. *On Delay* - allows time for the scribe to start before motion begins.

Save the parameters in the Config tab.

After the above directions are completed, the scribe may be tested manually by issuing a *M3 $1 S1* command in the MDI input. The user may find it helpful to use this method to scribe a small divot and then try to pulse the torch in the same location to align the offsets between the scribe and the torch.

To use the scribe from G-Code:

----
...
M52 P1 (paused motion on)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>
T1 M6 (select scribe)
G43 H0 (apply offsets for current tool)
M3 $1 S1 (start the scribe)
.
M5 $1 (stop the scribe)
.
T0 M6 (select torch)
G43 H0 (apply offsets for current tool)
G0 X0 Y0 (parking position)
M5 $-1 (end all)
----

It is a good idea to switch back to the torch at the end of the program before the final rapid parking move so the machine is always in the same state at idle.

The user can switch between the torch and the scribe any number of times during a program by using the appropriate G-Codes.

Issuing *M3 S1* (without $n) will cause the machine to behave as if an *M3 $0 S1* had been issued and issuing *M5* (without $n) will cause the machine to behave as if an *M5 $0* had been issued. This will control the torch firing by default in order to provide backward compatibility for previous G-Code files.

WARNING: If there is an existing manual tool change parameter set in the <machine_name>.hal file then QtPlasmaC will convert it to an automatic tool change.

[[qt_spotting]]

=== Spotting

To achieve spotting to mark the material prior to drilling etc., QtPlasmaC can pulse the torch for a short duration to mark the spot to drill.

Spotting can be configured by following these steps:

. Set the arc voltage *Threshold* in the Spotting section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>. Setting the voltage threshold to zero will cause the delay timer to begin immediately upon starting the torch. Setting the voltage threshold above zero will cause the delay timer to begin when the arc voltage reaches the threshold voltage.
. Set the *Time On* in the Spotting section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>. When the *Time On* timer has elapsed, the torch will turn off. Times are adjustable from 0 to 9999 milliseconds.

The torch is then turned on in G-Code with the *M3 $2 S1* command which selects the plasma torch as a spotting tool.

To enable spotting, see <<qt_multi-tool, multiple tools>>.

LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) requires some motion between any *M3* and *M5* commands. For this reason, a minimal movement at a high speed is required to be programmed.

An example G-Code is:

----
G21 (metric)
F99999 (high feed rate)
.
.
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $2 S1 (spotting on)
G91 (relative distance mode)
G1 X0.000001
G90 (absolute distance mode)
M5 $2 (spotting off)
.
.
G0 X0 Y0
G90
M2
----

NOTE: The *high feed rate* of 99999 is to ensure that the motion is at the machine's highest feed rate.

IMPORTANT: SOME PLASMA CUTTERS WILL NOT BE SUITABLE FOR THIS FEATURE. +
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE USER CARRY OUT SOME TEST SPOTTING TO ENSURE THAT THE PLASMA CUTTER IS CAPABLE OF UTILIZING THIS FEATURE.

[[qt_keyboard-shortcuts]]

=== Keyboard Shortcuts

Below is a list of all available keyboard shortcuts in QtPlasmaC that are in addition to the standard jogging keys. In order for the user to utilize them, *KB Shortcuts* must be enabled in the *GUI SETTINGS* section of the *PARAMETERS Tab*.

[[qt_shape-library]]

== Conversational Shape Library

image::images/qtplasmac_conversational.png[width=900,align="center"]

The *Conversational Shape Library* consists of several basic shapes and functions to assist the user with generating quick G-Code at the machine to cut simple shapes quickly. This feature is found on the <<qt_conversational-tab, CONVERSATIONAL Tab>>.

NOTE: The Conversational Library is not meant to be a CAD/CAM replacement as there are limitations to what can be achieved.

Blank entries in the shape input boxes will use the current setting at the time the G-Code was generated. For example, if *X start* was left blank then the current X axis position would be used.

All lead-ins and lead-outs are arcs except for:

* Small holes
* Stars

The cut order will occur in the same order as the shape was built.

Pressing *Return* on the keyboard while editing parameters will automatically show the preview of the shape if there are enough parameters entered to create the shape. Clicking any of the available check boxes will do the same.

The button functions are as follows:

[width="100%",cols="4,16"]
|===
|*Name*|*Description*
|New|Removes the current G-Code file and load a blank G-Code file.
|Save|Opens a dialog allowing the current shape to be saved as a G-Code file.
|Settings|Allows the changing of the global settings.
|Quit|Closes the Conversational Panel. All edits will be discarded.
|Send|Closes the Conversational Panel and load the current shape into LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC). If the last edit was not added then it will be discarded.
|Preview|Displays a preview of the current shape provided the required information is present.
|Continue|This button is used for lines and arcs only. Allows another segment to be added to the current segment/segments.
|Add|Stores the current shape into the current job.
|Undo|Reverts to the previously stored state. If there have been no edits since the last store, it will stay at the current state.
|===

If there is a G-Code file loaded in LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) when the Conversational Panel is opened, that code will be imported into the conversational as the first shape of the job. If this code is not required then it can be removed by pressing the New button.

NOTE: All distances are in machine units relative to the current User Coordinate System and all angles are in degrees.

=== Conversational Settings

Global settings for the shape library can be set by pressing the *Settings* button in the Conversational Panel. This will display all of the available settings parameters that are used for G-Code program creation. These include:

* *Preamble*
* *Postamble*
* *Origin (Center or Bottom Left)*
* *Lead-in length*
* *Lead-out length*
* *Small hole diameter*
* *Small hole speed*
* *Window Size*

Any internal circle that has a diameter less than *Small hole diameter* is classified as a small hole and will have a straight lead-in with a length that is the lesser of either the radius of the hole or the specified lead-in length. It will also have its feed rate set to *Small hole speed*.

Pressing the *Save* button will save all the settings as displayed and will change the window size to the displayed size.

After saving the user may press *Quit* or they may click on any shape to start the Conversational process.

=== Conversational Lines And Arcs

image::images/qtplasmac_conv_line.png[width=100,align="left"]

Lines and arcs have an additional option in that they may be strung together to create a complex shape.

There are two line types and three arc types available:

. *Line* given a start point and an end point.
. *Line* given a start point, length, and angle.
. *Arc* given a start point, way point, and end point.
. *Arc* given a start point, end point, and radius.
. *Arc* given a start point, length, angle, and radius.

To use lines and arcs:

. Select Lines and Arcs.
. Select the type of line or arc to create.
. Choose the material from the MATERIAL drop down. If no material is chosen, the default material (00000) will be used.
. Enter the desired parameters.
. Press *Preview* to see the shape.
. If satisfied with the shape press *Continue*.
. Change the line or arc type if needed and continue this procedure until the shape is complete.
. Press *Send* to send the G-Code file to LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) for cutting.

If the user wishes to create a closed shape, they will need to create any required lead-in as the first segment of the shape. If a lead-out is required it will need to be the last segment of the shape.

NOTE: At this stage there is no automatic option for a lead-in/lead-out creation if the shape is closed.

=== Conversational Single Shape

The following shapes are available for creation:

image::images/qtplasmac_conv_shapes.png[width=400,align="center"]

To create a shape:

. Select the shape to create. The available parameters will be displayed.
. Choose the material from the MATERIAL drop down. If no material is chosen, the default material (00000) will be used.
. Enter the appropriate values and press *Preview* to display the shape.
. If the shape is not correct, edit the values and press *Preview* and the new shape will be displayed. Repeat until satisfied with the shape.
. Press *Add* to add the shape to the G-Code file.
. Press *Send* to send the G-Code file to LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) for cutting.

=== Conversational Group Of Shapes

Multiple shapes can be added together to create a complex group.

The cut order of the group is determined by the order in which the individual shapes are added to the group.

Once a shape is added to the group it cannot be edited or removed.

Groups cannot have shapes removed, only added to.

To create a group of shapes:

. Create the first shape as in *Single Shape*.
. Press *Add* and the shape will be added to the group.
. If the user wishes to add another version of the same shape then edit the required parameters and press *Add* when satisfied with the shape.
. If the user wishes to add a different shape, select that shape and create it as in *Single Shape*.
. Repeat until all the required shapes to complete the group have been added.
. Press *Send* to send the G-Code file to LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) for cutting.

=== Conversational Rotate

image::images/qtplasmac_conv_rotate.png[width=100,align="left"]

The rotate feature will rotate the current code displayed in the Preview tab, this can be a single shape, a group or an imported G-Code file.

Arrays created via Conversational may be rotated, however arrays that have been imported cannot be rotated.

Rotation will not work on G-Code that is mathematically calculated, the values need to be specified.

. Create a shape, a group, or use the imported G-Code file.
. Press *Rotate* to open the rotate dialog.
. Enter the appropriate values in the rotate dialog and press *Preview* to display the rotated code.
. If the rotation is not correct, edit the values and press *Preview* and the new rotated code will be shown. Repeat until satisfied with the rotated code.
. Press *Add* to complete the procedure.
. Press *Send* to send the G-Code file to LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) for cutting.

=== Conversational Array

image::images/qtplasmac_conv_array.png[width=100,align="left"]

An array can be created from a shape, a group or an imported G-Code file.

Arrays created with Conversational may be arrayed but imported arrays cannot be arrayed.

The cut order of an array is from the left column to the right column, starting at the bottom row and ending at the top row.

. Create a shape, a group, or use the imported G-Code file.
. Press *Array* to open the array dialog.
. Enter the appropriate values in the array dialog and press *Preview* to display the array.
. If the array is not correct, edit the values and press *Preview* and the new array will be shown. Repeat until satisfied with the array.
. Press *Add* to complete the procedure.
. Press *Send* to send the G-Code file to LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) for cutting.

=== Conversational Saving A Job

The current job displayed in the Preview Panel may be saved at any time by using the bottom *Save* button. If the G-Code has been sent to LinuxCNC (QtPlasmaC) and the Conversational dialog box has closed, the user may still save the G-Code file from the GUI. Alternatively, the user could click the Conversational button in the Extras tab which will reload the job, at which time they can press the *Save* button.

== Error Messages

=== Critical Errors

There are a number of error messages printed by QtPlasmaC to inform the user of faults as they occur. The messages can be split into two groups, *Critical* and *Warning*.

Critical Errors will cause the running program to pause, and the operator will need to clear the cause of the error before proceeding.

If the error was received during cutting then forward or reverse motion is allowed while the machine is paused to enable the user to reposition the machine prior to resuming the cut.

When the error is cleared the program may be resumed.

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated during cutting:

* *breakaway switch activated program is paused*
* *float switch activated program is paused*
* *ohmic probe activated program is paused*

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated before probing commenced:

* *ohmic probe detected before probing program is paused*
* *float switch detected before probing program is paused*
* *breakaway switch detected before probing program is paused*

The Arc OK signal was lost during cutting motion, before the *M5* command was reached:

* *valid arc lost program is paused*

The Z axis reached the bottom limit before the work piece was detected:

* *bottom limit reached while probing down program is paused*

The work piece is too high for any safe rapid removes:

* *material too high for safe traverse program is paused*

One of these values in MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> is invalid (For example: if they are set to zero):

* *invalid pierce height or invalid cut height or invalid cut volts program is paused*

No arc has been detected after attempting to start the number of times indicated by *Max Starts* in the ARC frame of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>:

* *no arc detected after <n>d start attempts program is paused*
* *no arc detected after <n>d start attempts manual cut is stopped*

THC has caused the bottom limit to be reached while cutting:

* *bottom limit reached while THC moving down program is paused*

THC has caused the top limit to be reached while cutting:

* *top limit reached while THC moving up program is paused*

The move to pierce height would exceed the Z Axis MAX_LIMIT. This was determined after the material height was detected via float switch:

* *pierce height would exceed Z axis maximum limit while float switch probing*

The move to pierce height would exceed the Z Axis MAX_LIMIT. This was determined after the material height was detected via ohmic sensing:

* *pierce height would exceed Z axis maximum limit while ohmic probing*

=== Warning Errors

Warning errors will not pause a running program and are informational only.

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated before a probe test commenced:

* *ohmic probe detected before probing probe test aborted*
* *float switch detected before probing probe test aborted*
* *breakaway switch detected before probing probe test aborted*

This indicates that the corresponding sensor was activated during a consumable change:

* *breakaway float or ohmic activated during consumable, change motion is paused* +
*WARNING: MOTION WILL RESUME IMMEDIATELY UPON RESOLVING THIS CONDITION!*

WARNING: CONSUMABLE CHANGE MOTION WILL RESUME IMMEDIATELY UPON RESOLVING THE CORRESPONDING SENSOR ACTIVATION.

This indicates that probe contact was lost before probing up to find the zero point:

* *probe trip error while probing*

This indicates the bottom limit was reached during a probe test:

* *bottom limit reached while probe testing*

This indicates that the safe height has been reduced due to THC raising the Z axis during cutting:

* *safe traverse height has been reduced*

This indicates that the value for the Arc Voltage was invalid (NAN or INF) when QtPlasmaC launched.

* *invalid arc-voltage-in*

[[qt_update]]

== Updating QtPlasmaC

=== Standard Update

QtPlasmaC update notices are posted at: https://forum.linuxcnc.org/plasmac/37233-plasmac-updates

*Users are strongly encouraged to create a Username and subscribe to the above thread to receive update notices.*

For a standard ISO installation, LinuxCNC will only be updated when a new minor release has been released. QtPlasmaC will then automatically update its configuration the first time it is run after a LinuxCNC update.

LinuxCNC is normally updated by entering the following commands into a terminal window (one at a time):

----
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
----

=== Continuous Update

Enhancements and bug fixes will not be available on a standard installation until a new minor release of LinuxCNC has been released. If the user wishes to update whenever a new QtPlasmaC version has been pushed, they could use the LinuxCNC Buildbot repository rather than the standard LinuxCNC repository by following the instructions at: http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/

== Customizing QtPlasmaC GUI

Styling of the QtPlasmaC GUI is done with Qt stylesheets and some customization may be achieved by the use of a custom stylesheet. This allows the user to change some GUI items such as color, border, size, etc. It cannot change the layout of the GUI.

Information on Qt stylesheets is available link:https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.11/stylesheet.html[here]

There are two methods available to apply custom styles:

. Add A Custom Style: use this for minor style changes.

. Create A New Style use this for a complete style change.

=== Add A Custom Style

Adding style changes to the default stylesheet is achieved by creating a file in the machine config folder. This file MUST be named qtplasmac_custom.qss. Any required style changes are then added to this file.

For example the user may want the arc voltge dispay in red, a green Torch On LED of a larger size and a larger Torch Enable button. This would be done with the following code in qtplasmac_custom.qss:

----
#arc_voltage {
    color: #ff0000 }

#led_torch_on {
    qproperty-diameter: 30;
    qproperty-color: green }

#torch_enable::indicator {
    width: 30;
    height: 30}
----

=== Create A New Style

Custom stylesheets are enable by a setting in the [QTPLASMAC] section of the INI file with the filename of the stylesheet.

----
CUSTOM_STYLE = my_cool_style.qss
----

The filename may be any valid filename. The standard extension name is .qss but this is not mandatory.

There are some constraints on the custom stylesheet for QtPlasmaC, e.g. the jog buttons, cut-recovery buttons, and the conversational shape buttons are image files and are not able to be custom styled.

The custom style file requires a header in the following format:

----
/*****************************
Custom Stylesheet Header

color1 = #000000
#QtPlasmaC default = #ffee06

color2 = #e0e0e0
#QtPlasmaC default = #16160e

color3 = #c0c0c0
#QtPlasmaC default = #ffee06

color4 = #e0e0e0
#QtPlasmaC default = #26261e

color5 = #808080
#QtPlasmaC default = #b0b0b0

*****************************/
----

The colors may be expressed in any valid stylesheet format.

The above colors are used for the following widgets. So any custom styling will need to take these into account. The colors shown below are the defaults used in QtPlasmaC along with the color name from the PARAMETERS tab.

== QtPlasmaC Advanced Topics

[[qt_custom-user-buttons]]

=== Custom User Buttons

The QtPlasmaC GUI offers user buttons that can be customized by adding commands in the <machine_name>.ini file.

The number of user buttons varies by display type and resolution as follows:

* 16:9 and 4:3 - Minimum 8, Maximum 20
* 9:16 - Minimum 15, Maximum 20

All <machine_name>.ini file settings for the buttons are found in the [QTPLASMAC] section.

.Button Names

The text that appears on the button is set the following way:

----
BUTTON_n_NAME = HAL Show
----

Where n is the button number and *HAL Show* is the text.

For text on multiple lines, split the text with a \

----
BUTTON_n_NAME = HAL\Show
----

.Button Code

Buttons can run the following:

. <<qt_button-cmds, External commands>>
. <<qt_button-code, G-Code commands>>
. <<qt_button-toggle, Toggle a HAL pin>>
. <<qt_button-probe, Probe test>>
. <<qt_button-ohmic, Ohmic Test>>
. <<qt_button-cut, Cut Type>>
. <<qt_button-consumables, Change consumables>>
. <<qt_button-load, Load a G-Code program>>
. <<qt_button-torch, Pulse the torch on>>
. <<qt_button-single, Single unidirectional cut>>
. <<qt_button-framing, Framing a job>>

[[qt_button-cmds]]

[underline]*External Commands*

To run an external command, the command is preceded by a % character.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = %halshow
----

[[qt_button-code]]

[underline]*G-Code*

To run G-Code, just enter the code to be run.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = G0 X100
----

To run an existing subroutine.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = o<my_subroutine> call
----

<machine_name>.ini file variables can be entered by using {} (a space must be placed after the })

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = G0 X{JOINT_0 HOME} Y1
BUTTON_n_CODE = G53 G0 Z[{AXIS_Z MAX_LIMIT} - 1.001]
----

Multiple codes can be run by separating the codes with a \ symbol. The exception is the special commands which are required to be a single command per button.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = G0 X0 Y0 \ G1 X5 \ G1 Y5
----

External commands and G-Code may be mixed on the same button.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = %halshow \ g0x.5y.5 \ %halmeter
----

[[qt_button-toggle]]

[underline]*Toggle HAL Pin*

The following code will allow the user to use a button to invert the current state of a HAL bit pin (this code is required to be used as a single command and may only control one HAL bit pin per button):

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = toggle-halpin my-hal-pin-name
----

After setting the code, upon clicking, the button will turn green, invert the pin state, and stay "latched" until it is clicked again. Clicking again will return the button to the original color and invert the pin state.

[[qt_button-probe]]

[underline]*Probe Test*

QtPlasmaC will begin a probe and when the material is detected, the Z axis will rise to the Pierce Height currently displayed in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>. If the user has "View Material" selected in the GUI SETTINGS section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>, this value will be displayed in the top left corner of the PREVIEW Window next to *PH:*. QtPlasmaC will then wait in this state for the time specified (in seconds) before returning the Z axis to the starting position. An example of a 10 second delay is below. It there is no time specified then it will default to 10 seconds.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = probe-test 10
----

[[qt_button-ohmic]]

[underline]*Ohmic Test*

QtPlasmaC will enable the Ohmic Probe Enable output signal and if the Ohmic Probe input is sensed, the LED indicator in the Monitor Panel will light. The main purpose of this is to allow a quick test for a shorted torch tip.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = ohmic-test
----

[[qt_button-cut]]

[underline]*Cut Type*

This button if selected will toggle between the two <<qt_cut-types, cut types>>, Pierce and Cut (default cutting mode) or Pierce Only.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = cut-type
----

[[qt_button-consumables]]

[underline]*Change Consumables*

Pressing this button moves the torch to the specified coordinates when the machine is paused to allow the user easy access to change the torch consumables.

Valid entries are Xnnn Ynnn Fnnn. Feed Rate (F) is mandatory and at least one of the X or Y coordinates are required.

The X and Y coordinates are in absolute machine coordinates. If X or Y are missing then the current coordinate for that axis will be used.

There are three methods to return to the previous coordinates:

. Press the Change Consumables button again - the torch will return to the original coordinates and the machine will wait in this position for the user to resume the program.
. Resume the program - the torch to return to the original coordinates and the program will resume.
. Stop the program - the torch to return to the original coordinates and the program will abort.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = change-consumables X10 Y10 F1000
----

[[qt_button-load]]

[underline]*Load*

Load a G-Code program by using the following format:

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = load path/to/G-Code.ngc
----

The path is relative to the directory specified by *PROGRAM_PREFIX* in the <machine_name>.ini file. This is usually ~/linuxcnc/nc_files. For example: If the user's G-Code file was in a subdirectory of the *PROGRAM_PREFIX* directory named *plasma* then the entry would be *plasma/G-Code.ngc*.

[[qt_button-torch]]

[underline]*Torch Pulse*

Pulse the torch on for a predetermined time. The time must be specified in seconds and the maximum allowable time is 3 seconds, anything specified above that will be limited to 3 seconds. An example of a 0.5 second pulse is below. It there is no time specified then it will default to 1 second.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = torch-pulse 0.5
----

[[qt_button-single]]

[underline]*Single Cut*

Run a single unidirectional cut. This utilises the automatic <<qt_single-cut, Single Cut>> feature.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = single-cut
----

[[qt_button-framing]]

[underline]*Framing*

Framing is the ability to move the torch around the perimeter of a rectangle that encompasses the bounds of the current job.

The laser enable HAL pin (qtplasmac.laser_on) will be enabled during the framing moves and any X/Y offsets for the laser pointer in the <machine_name>.ini file will also be applied to the X/Y motion.

Upon starting a Framing cycle, it is important to note that by default the Z axis will be moved to a height of [AXIS_Z]MAX_LIMIT - 5mm before X/Y motion begins.

Framing motion will occur at the feed rate for the currently selected material.

The following GUI buttons and Keyboard Shortcuts (if enabled in the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>) are valid during Framing motion:

. Pressing CYCLE STOP or the ESC <<qt_keyboard-shortcuts, keyboard shortcut>> - Stops Framing motion.
. Pressing CYCLE PAUSE or the SPACE BAR <<qt_keyboard-shortcuts, keyboard shortcut>>- Pauses Framing motion.
. Pressing CYCLE RESUME or the CTRL+r <<qt_keyboard-shortcuts, keyboard shortcut>>- Resumes paused Framing motion.
. Changing the FEED SLIDER or any of the CTRL+0-9 <<qt_keyboard-shortcuts, keyboard shortcuts>> - Slows the feed rate.

NOTE: IF THE FEED RATE IS CHANGED FOR THE FRAMING MOTION, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO RETURN THE FEED SLIDER TO 100% BEFORE PRESSING CYCLE START AND CUTTING THE LOADED JOB.

Framing can be started two different ways:

1 - Via a user button by adding the following to an available user button in the <machine_name>.ini file.
----
BUTTON_n_CODE = framing
----

For this method *only* it is possible for the user to omit the initial Z movement and run the framing sequence at the current Z height by adding "usecurrentZheight" after "framing".

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = framing usecurrentZheight
----

2 - Framing may also be achieved with the use of the HAL pin qtplasmac.framing_start. Setting this pin to 1 (True) will begin a framing move if QtPlasmaC is in a valid state. *It is incumbent on the user to ensure this pin returns to 0 (False) otherwise subsequent framing moves will not be possible.* It is not possible to run framing without the initial Z movement via this method.

There is no requirement that a user button be setup to use the HAL pin variant although it is possible to use both methods in the same config.

=== Tuning Void Sensing

Void sensing may be further tuned by adjusting the required number of consecutive times that the threshold has been exceeded before applying the void lock to the THC.

The HAL pin for adjusting this is named plasmac.kerf-errors-max and the default value is 2. To change this value, add the pin and the required value to the <machine_name>_connections.hal file. The following example would set the required number of consecutive times to exceed the threshold to 3:

----
setp plasmac.kerf-error-max 3
----

=== Lost Arc Delay

Some plasma power sources/machine configurations may lose the Arc OK signal either momentarily during a cut, or permanently near the end of a cut causing QtPlasmaC to pause the program and report a "valid arc lost" error. There is a HAL pin named *plasmac.arc-lost-delay* that may be used to set a delay (in seconds) that will prevent a paused program/error if the lost Arc OK signal is regained, or the *M5* command is reached before the set delay period expires. It is important to note that the THC will be disabled and locked at the cutting height at the time the Arc OK signal was lost.

The following code would set a delay of 0.1 seconds:

----
setp plasmac.arc-lost-delay 0.1
----

It is recommended that the user set this pin in the <machine_name>_connections.hal file.

This setting should only be used if the user experiences the above symptoms. It should also be noted that the user could use the appropriate <<qt_ignore-ok, Ignore Arc OK>> G-Code commands to achieve a similar result.

=== Zero Window

Small fluctuations in the arc voltage displayed while the machine is at idle are possible depending on many different variables (electrical noise, incorrect THCAD tuning, etc.). After all contributing factors have been mitigated, if a small fluctuation still exists it is possible to eliminate it by widening the voltage window for which PlasmaC will display 0v.

The pin for adjusting this value is named plasmac.zero-window and the default value is set to 0.1. To change this value, add the pin and the required value to the <machine_name>_connections.hal file. The following example would set the voltage window to be displayed as 0v from -5v to +5v:

----
setp plasmac.zero-window 5
----

=== Max Offset

Max Offset is the distance (in millimeters) away from the Z MAX_LIMIT that PlasmaC will allow the Z axis to travel while under machine control.

The pin for adjusting this value is named plasmac.max-offset and the default value (in millimeters) is set to 5. To change this value, add the pin and the required value to the <machine_name>_connections.hal file. It is not recommended to use values less than 5mm as offset overrun may cause unforeseen issues.

The following example would set the distance from Z MAX_LIMIT to 10mm:

----
setp plasmac.max-offset 10
----

=== QtPlasmaC State Outputs

The PlasmaC component has a HAL pin named *plasmac.state-out* which can be used to interface with user-coded components to provide the current state of the component.

The different states PlasmaC could encounter are as follows:

[width="25%"]
|===
|*State*|*Description*
|0|IDLE
|1|PROBE_HEIGHT
|2|PROBE_DOWN
|3|PROBE_UP
|4|ZERO_HEIGHT
|5|PIERCE_HEIGHT
|6|TORCH_ON
|7|ARC_OK
|8|PIERCE_DELAY
|9|PUDDLE_JUMP
|10|CUT_HEIGHT
|11|CUT
|12|PAUSE_AT_END
|13|SAFE_HEIGHT
|14|MAX_HEIGHT
|15|FINISH
|16|TORCHPULSE
|17|PAUSED_MOTION
|18|OHIMC_TEST
|19|PROBE_TEST
|20|SCRIBING
|21|CONSUMABLE_CHANGE_ON
|22|CONSUMABLE_CHANGE_OFF
|23|CUT_RECOVERY_ON
|24|CUT_RECOVERY_OFF
|25|DEBUG
|===

The DEBUG state is for testing purposes only and will not normally be encountered.

=== QtPlasmaC Debug Print

The PlasmaC component has a HAL pin named *plasmac.debug-print* which if set to 1 (true) will print to terminal every state change as a debug aid.

[[qt_pm_comms]]

=== Hypertherm PowerMax Communications

Communications can be established with a Hypertherm PowerMax plasma cutter that has a RS485 port. This feature enables the setting of *Cut Mode*, *Cutting Amperage* and *Gas Pressure* automatically from the *Cut Parameters* of the material file.

If *Gas Pressure* is set to Zero then the PowerMax will automatically calculate the required pressure from the *Cut Mode*, *Cut Current*, torch type, and torch length.

Changing the cutting mode will set the gas pressure to zero causing the machine to use its automatic gas pressure mode.

The maximum and minimum values of these parameters are read from the plasma cutter and the related spin-buttons in the Cut Parameters are then limited by these values. Gas pressure cannot be changed from zero until communications have been established.

This feature is enabled by setting the correct port name for the PM_PORT variable in the [QTPLASMAC] section of the <machine_name>.ini file. If the PM_PORT variable is not set in the <machine_name>.ini file then the widgets associated with this feature will not be visible.

Example showing enabling the Hypertherm PowerMax Communications on USB0:

----
[QTPLASMAC]
PM_PORT = /dev/ttyusb0
----

If the user is unsure of the name of the port, there is a python script in the configuration directory that will show all available ports and can also be used to test communications with the plasma unit prior to enabling this feature in the QtPlasmaC GUI.

To use the test script follow these instructions:

For a package installation (Buildbot) enter the following command in a terminal window:

----
pmx485-test
----

For a run in place installation enter the following two commands in a terminal window:

----
source ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/rip-environment
pmx485-test
----

The gas pressure units display (psi or bar) is determined by the data received during initial setup of the communication link and is then shown next to the Gas Pressure setting in the MATERIAL section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

The PowerMax machine will go into remote mode after communications have been established and may only be controlled remotely (via the QtPlasmaC GUI) at this point. The connection can be validated by observing the PowerMax display.

To switch the PowerMax back to local mode the user can either:

. Disable PowerMax Comms from the <<qt_main-tab, MAIN Tab>>
. Close LinuxCNC which will put the PowerMax into local mode during shutdown.
. Turn the PowerMax off for 30 seconds and then power it back on.

TIP: If PowerMax communications is active then selecting <<qt_mesh-mode, Mesh Mode>> will automatically select CPA mode on the PowerMax unit.

NOTE: To use the PowerMax communications feature it is necessary to have the python pyserial module installed. +
If pyserial is not installed an error message will be displayed.

To install pyserial, enter the following command into a terminal window:

----
sudo apt install python-serial
----

A typical <<qt_rs485_connections, connection diagram>> is shown in the appendix of this document as well as confirmed working interfaces.

== Appendix

=== Example Configurations

There are example configuration files which use the PlasmaC HAL component to simulate plasma cutting machines.

* metric_plasmac.ini
* imperial_plasmac.ini

If the user has copied any example configs to the ~/linuxcnc/configs directory then they are able to be updated by running the qtplasmac-setup program in Update mode. This will replace any copied QtPlasmaC system file with a link to the latest version the user has updated to.

=== NGC Samples

There are some sample G-Code files in nc_files/plasmac.

=== Change Type Of LinuxCNC Installation

Before changing the type of installation, the existing QtPlasmaC installation needs to be updated to the latest version. If QtPlasmaC is not at the latest version then changing the installation type may corrupt the existing QtPlasmaC configuration.

It is recommended that a <<qt_backup, backup>> copy of the existing QtPlasmaC configuration is made before proceeding.

If the user has changed the type of LinuxCNC installation from a Package installation (Buildbot) to a Run In Place or vice versa the user will need to run the qtplasmac-setup program from the new LinuxCNC installation directory, NOT from the ~/linuxcnc/configs directory. This is required to reset the file links for the correct installation type.

Enter the following command into a terminal window do one of the following:

Reset to a new Package installation (Buildbot):

----
qtplasmac-setup
----

Reset to a new Run In Place installation:

----
qtplasmac-setup
----

[[qt_mesa-thcad]]

=== Mesa THCAD

The Mesa THCAD is the most common way of obtaining the arc voltage from a plasma cutter. The THCAD may be used for parallel port configurations or for configurations using Mesa Electronics hardware.

Add these parameters to the .hal file that was created as a result of making a working and tested base machine configuration.

.Parallel Port Config

An example parallel port config using a link:http://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/man/man9/encoder.9.html[software encoder].

THCAD jumper settings *UNIPOLAR* and *F/64*

NOTE: If the user's computer has good latency then they may be able to use *F/32*

----
loadrt encoder num_chan=1
setp encoder.0.counter−mode 1
setp encoder.0.position−scale -1
addf encoder.update-counters base-thread
addf encoder.capture-position servo-thread
net arc-voltage-raw parport.1.pin-04-in encoder.0.phase-A
----

The user then needs to note that the *Arc Voltage HAL Pin* entry in the qtplasmac-setup program will be:

----
encoder.0.velocity
----

.Mesa 7i96 Config:

An example Mesa 7i96 config using the onboard hardware encoder is shown below. Other Mesa hardware will be similar but with a different board identifiers.

THCAD jumper settings *UNIPOLAR* and *F/32*

----
setp  hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.scale -1
setp  hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.filter 1
setp  hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.counter-mode 1
----

The user then needs to note that the *Arc Voltage HAL Pin* entry in the qtplasmac-setup program will be:

----
hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.velocity
----

NOTE: There is a <<qt_lowpass, lowpass filter>> available which may be useful if using a THCAD and there is a lot of noise on the returned arc voltage.

.Obtaining The Divider Ratio

[underline]*THCAD-10*

If connecting to a plasma CNC port then the divider ratio is selected from the plasma machine.

If connecting to the plasma machines full arc voltage then a common setup is to use a 1 Megohm resistor from arc negative to THCAD negative and a 1 Megohm resistor from arc positive to THCAD positive. This gives a full scale reading of 210V. The THCAD can handle over-voltages up to 500V indefinitely.

To get the divider ratio use (R1 + R2 + 100000) / 100000. An example with the above resistance values would be: (1000000 + 1000000 + 100000) / 100000, giving a ratio of 21.

IMPORTANT: IF THE USER IS USING A HF START PLASMA POWER SUPPLY THEN EACH OF THESE RESISTANCES SHOULD BE MADE UP OF SEVERAL HIGH VOLTAGE RESISTORS.

[underline]*THCAD-300*

This is connected to the plasma machines full arc voltage and the divider ratio = 1

[[qt_calibration-values]]

.Calibration Values

These values are used to obtain starting values for Voltage Offset and Voltage Scale in the ARC frame of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>>.

They are located on the rear of the THCAD via a calibration sticker showing:

----
    THCAD-nnn

 0V  121.1 kHz
 5V  925.3 kHz
----

or similar values, these are the frequencies generated by the THCAD for 0 volts and full scale volts respectively.

The *Voltage Scale* and *Voltage Offset* can now be calculated manually, as shown below, or by using https://jscalc.io/calc/NTr5QDX6WgMThBVb[this online calulator].

[underline]*Voltage Scale*

Use the formula:

----
Divider_Ratio / ((THCAD_Full_Scale_Frequency - THCAD_0V_Frequency) / THCAD_Frequency_Divider / THCAD_Full_Scale_Voltage)
----

This result will be used for setting *Voltage Scale* in the THC frame of the PLASMAC CONFIGURATION section of the <<qt_parameters-tab, PARAMETERS Tab>> when setting up the configuration.

THCAD-10 example with a jumper setting of F/32 would be:

----
21 / ((925300 - 121100) / 32 / 10) = 0.00835613
----

For the calculation above, 21 comes from the divider calculation example, 32 is the jumper setting *F/32*, and 10 is the full scale reading of the THCAD card itself.

THCAD-300 example would be:

----
1 / ((925300 - 121100) / 32 / 300) = 0.01193732
----

For our calculation above, 1 is the divider ratio, 32 is the jumper setting *F/32*, and 300 is the full scale reading of the THCAD card itself.


[underline]*Voltage Offset*

Use the formula:

----
THCAD_0V_Frequency / THCAD_Frequency_Divider
----

This result will be used for setting *Voltage Offset* in the Config Panel when setting up the configuration.

The THCAD-10 and THCAD-300 examples above would be:

----
121100 / 32 = 3784.375
----

[[qt_reed-arc-ok]]

=== Arc OK With A Reed Relay

An effective and very reliable method of obtaining an Arc OK signal from a plasma power supply without a CNC port is to mount a reed relay inside a non-conductive tube and wrap and secure three turns of the work lead around the tube.

This assembly will now act as a relay that will switch on when current is flowing through the work lead which only occurs when a cutting arc has been established.

This will require that QtPlasmaC be operated in Mode 1 rather than Mode 0. See the <<qt_ini-mode, INI File>> and <<qt_mode, QtPlasmaC Modes>> sections for more information.

== Known Issues

=== Keyboard Jogging

There is a known issue with the isAutoRepeat() function in Qt which causes unexpected key pressed/key released behaviors. These random key releases while a jog key is still being held down causes jerky/erratic jogging behavior. There are several bug reports citing this issue at the Qt project level.

This condition is known and is worked around in 3 stages to provide the best/most consistent behavior possible. However, at times the user may notice unexpected jogging behavior. If odd behavior is noticed while a key is pressed then releasing the key will stop the active jog. If a jog continues after a key is released then pressing and releasing the key again will stop the active jog.

Due to the issue with isAutoRepeat(), unexpected behavior with jogging has been observed and is believed to be caused as a result of multiple windows being open, and the QtPlasmaC window losing keyboard focus during the jog. For this reason, it is highly recommended that the user not run any other programs while using QtPlasmaC.

This issue does not affect any jogging using the GUI jog buttons.

== Support

Online help and support is available from the https://forum.linuxcnc.org/plasmac[PlasmaC section] of the https://forum.linuxcnc.org/[LinuxCNC Forum].

The user can create a compressed file containing the complete machine configuration to aid in fault diagnosis by pressing following the directions in the <<qt_backup, backup>> section. The resulting file is suitable for attaching to a post on the LinuxCNC Forum to help the community diagnose specific issues.
