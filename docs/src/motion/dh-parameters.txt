= Setting up "modified" Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters for
'genserkins'

== Prelude

LinuxCNC supports a number of kinematics modules including one that
supports a generalized set of serial kinematics commonly specified via
Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.

This document illustrates a method to set up the DH-parameters for a
Mitsubishi RV-6SDL in LinuxCNC using 'genserkins' kinematics.

[NOTE]

This document does not cover the creation of a 'vismach' model which,
while certainly very useful, requires just as much careful modeling
if it is to match the 'genserkins' model derived in this document.

== General

With the proliferation of industrial robots comes an increased
interest to control used robots with LinuxCNC.  A common type of robot
used in industry and manufacturing is the "serial manipulator"
designed as a series of motorized joints connected by rigid links.
Serial robots often have six joints as required for the six degrees of
freedom needed to both position (XYZ) and orient (ABC or pitch, roll,
yaw) an object in space.  Often these robots have an arm structure
that extends from a base to an end-effector.

Control of such a serial robot requires the calculation of the
end-effector's position and orientation in relation to a reference
coordinate system when the joint angles are known (*forward
kinematics*) and also the more complex reverse calculation of the
required joint angles for a given end-effector position and
orientation in relation to the reference coordinate system (*inverse
kinematics*).  The standard mathematical tools used for these
calculations are matrices which are basically tables of parameters and
formulas that make it easier to handle the rotations and translations
involved in forward and inverse kinematics calculations.

Detailed familiarity with the math is not required for a serial robot
since LinuxCNC provides a kinematics module that implements an
algorithm called 'genserkins' to calculate the forward and inverse
kinematics for a generic serial robot.  In order to control a specific
serial robot, 'genserkins' must be provided with data so that it can
build a mathematical model of the robot's mechanical structure and
thus do the math.

The required data needs to be in a standardized form that has been
introduced by Jacques Denavit and Richard Hartenberg back in the
fifties and are called the DH-Parameters.  Denavit and Hartenberg used
four parameters to describe how one joint is linked to the next.
These parameters describe basically two rotations ('alpha' and
'theta') and two translations ('a' and 'd').

== Modified DH-Parameters

As is often the case, this "standard" has been modified by other
authors who have introduced "modified DH-parameters" and one must be
very careful because 'genserkins' uses "modified DH-parameters" as
described in the publication "Introduction to Robotics, Mechanics and
Control" by John J. Craig.  Beware there is a lot of information to be
found on 'DH-parameters' but rarely does the author define which
convention is actually used.  In addition, some people have found it
necessary to change the parameter named 'a' to 'r' and have thus added
to the confusion.  This document adheres to the convention in the
above mentioned publication by Craig with the difference that joint
and parameter enumeration begins with the number '0' in order to be
consistent with 'genserkins' and its HAL pins.

Standard and Modified DH-Parameters consist of four numeric values for
each joint ('a', 'd', 'alpha' and 'theta') that describe how the
coordinate system (CS) sitting in one joint has to be moved and
rotated to be aligned with the next joint.  Aligned means that the
Z-axis of our CS coincides with the axis of rotation of the joint and
points in the positive direction such that, using the right hand rule
with the thumb pointing in the positive direction of the Z-axis, the
fingers point in the positive direction of rotation of the joint.
It becomes clear that in order to do this, one must decide on
the positive directions of all joints before starting to derive the
parameters!

The difference between "standard" and "modified" notations is in how
the parameters are allocated to the links.  Using the "standard"
DH-Parameters in 'genserkins' will *not* give the correct mathematical
model.

== Modified DH-Parameters as used in 'genserkins'

Note that 'genserkins' does not handle offsets to theta-values -- theta
is the joint variable that is *controlled* by LinuxCNC.  With the CS
aligned with the joint, a rotation around its Z-Axis is identical to
the rotation commanded to that joint by LinuxCNC. This makes it
impossible to define the 0Â° position of our robots joints arbitrarily.

The three configurable parameters are:

. *alpha* : positive or negative rotation (in radians) around the X-axis
of the "current coordinate system"

. *a* : positive distance, along X, between two joint axes specified in
'machine units' (mm or inch) defined in the system's ini file.

. *d* : positive or negative length along Z (also in 'machine units')

The parameter sets are always derived in the same order and a set is
completed by setting the d-parameter.  This does not leave the Z-axis
of our CS aligned with the next joint!  This may seem confusing but
sticking to this rule will yield a working set of parameters.  Once
the *d*-parameter is set, the X-axis of our-CS needs to point to the
axis of the next joint.

== Numbering of joints and parameters

The first joint in LinuxCNC is joint-0 (because in software
counting starts with 0) while most publications start with the number
'1'.  That goes for all the parameters as well.  That is, numbering
starts with a-0, alpha-0, d-0 and ends with a-5, alpha-5 and d-5.  Keep
this in mind when following a publication to set up 'genserkins'
parameters.

== How to start

Convention is to start by placing the reference-CS in the base of
the robot with it's Z-axis coinciding with the axis of the first joint
and its X-axis pointing toward the next joint's axis.

This will also result in the DRO values in LinuxCNC being referenced
to that point.  Having done so sets a-0 and alpha-0 to 0.  The above
mentioned publication (Craig) also sets d-0 to 0, which is confusing
when a displacement offset is needed in order to have the
reference-CS at the bottom of the base.  Setting d-0 = to the
displacement gives correct results.  In this manner, the first set of
parameters are alpha-0 = 0, a-0 = 0, d0 = displacement, and the X-axis
of the CS points to the axis of the next joint (joint-1).

Derivation of the net set (alpha-1, a-1, d-1) follows -- always using
the same sequence all the way to the sixth set (alpha-5, a-5, d-5).

And thus, the TCP-CS of the end-effector is sitting in the center of the
hand flange.

== Special cases

If the next joint-axis is parallel to the last then one could
arbitrarily choose a value for the d-parameter but there is no
point in setting it other than 0.

== Detailed Example (RV-6SL)

Described below is a method to derive the required "modified
DH-parameters" for a Mitsubishi RV-6SDL and how to set the parameters
in the HAL file to be used with the 'genserkins' kinematics in
LinuxCNC.  The necessary dimensions are best taken from a dimensional
drawing provided by the manufacturer of the robot.
