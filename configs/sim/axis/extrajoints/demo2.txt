extrajoints demo2

Demo of the motmod num_extrajoints= parameter

a) XYYZ correspond one-to-one to joints 0123
b) Joint4 is an 'extra joint' that is not
   related to any axis letter but is managed
   independently by a limit3 component.
c) The configuration uses basic_sim.tcl
   and simulates home switches for all joints.
d) Using extra joints requires NON-identity
   kinematicss and all joints (including joint4) must
   be homed before switching to coordinated positioning.
e) A halshow app is opened to display key pin values
f) A sim_pin app is opened to set key pin values

Usage:
1) F1        (Estop Off)
2) F2        (Machine On)
3) optionally jog joint4 prior to homing
4) Ctrl-HOME (Home all)
5) demonstrate joint4 movement using the provided
   M144 mdi command:
   M144 P1.23 move to 1.23
   M144 P4.56 move to 4.56
   M144       move to 0
   etc.
6) Alternately, demonstrate joint4 movement using
   sim_pin settings:
     j4.limit3.min  min value
     j4.limit3.max  max value
     j4.limit3.maxv max velocity
     j4.limit3.maxa max acceleration
     j4.limit3.in   requested value
