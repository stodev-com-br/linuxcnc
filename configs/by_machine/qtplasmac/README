A Qtvcp GUI for PlasmaC based on a theme by pinder on the LinuxCNC forum

This GUI is in development and is not yet fully functional but can be opened as a LinuxCNC sim to get an idea of how it looks and feels. 

Three versions available in both metric and imperial units:
1. qtplasmac_l - 16:9 format, minimum resolution 1366x768
2. qtplasmac_p  - 9:16 format,minimum resolution 768x1366
3. qtplasmac_s - 4:3 minimum resolution 1024x768

If you switch between unit types you will need to remove the .prefs file before opening a different version.
